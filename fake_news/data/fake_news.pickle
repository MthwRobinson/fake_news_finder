VMake the Road New York, an immigrant advocacy group, told the media this evening that Immigration and Customs Enforcement sweeps on Staten Island netted five Mexican nationals in the past week and a half\u2014coinciding with similar actions across the nation.\u000a\u000aThe raids took place on February 2, February 3, February 5 and February 8, according to speakers on the press call. All five individuals taken by ICE officers were male, and four of them have children who are U.S. citizens, the group reported.\u000a\u000aMake the Road believes several of the men are now in New Jersey detention centers.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen is that the incidents in Staten Island are consistent with what we\u2019ve seen with the surge of ICE activity in the last week,\u201d Theo Oshiro, deputy director of Make the Road New York said.\u000a\u000aImmigration authorities arrested hundreds of undocumented immigrants in at least six states in raids this past week, pursuant to an executive order Trump signed last month.\u000a\u000aThat fiat expanded the category of immigrants lacking proper paperwork that federal authorities would target for arrest and expulsion. Rather than focusing, as President Barack Obama did, on individuals with violent criminal convictions, ICE now has a mandate to nab undocumented immigrants if they have ever been accused of any crime, even \u201cwhere such charge has not been resolved.\u201d\u000a\u000aTrump has also signed executive orders that call for the construction of a wall on the Mexican border and federal funding cuts for sanctuary cities, which offer safe haven to undocumented immigrants.\u000a\u000aCarlos Vargas, a member of Make the Road New York\u2019s legal services team, said that in one case, two plainclothes officers approached a \u201chardworking\u201d father at 5:30 a.m., showed him a few pictures of people for whom they were looking and subsequently arrested and detained him.\u000a\u000aIn another case, ICE agents showed a family more than 10 pictures of people for whom they were looking and left when they did not identify the individual. They subsequently came back 20 minutes later and detained one of them.\u000a\u000aIn his first interview as president-elect, Trump said that he would deport or incarcerate up to three million undocumented immigrants who he says are \u201ccriminal and have criminal records, gang members, drug dealers,\u201d claiming that the country has \u201ca lot of these people.\u201d Experts estimate his executive order could impact as many as eight million people, more than two-thirds of foreign nationals who entered or who have remained the United States without authorization.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe do not know,\u201d Oshiro continued, concerning the question of whether the individuals have criminal records. \u201cWhat we do know is that the raids tear families apart and have a huge and negative impact on communities regardless of criminal records.\u000a\u000aNatalia Aristizabal, lead organizer for Make the Road New York, said that the group has been working with community members and conducting \u201cKnow Your Rights\u201d trainings to keep people informed.\u000a\u000aIn response to rumors about other raids across the city in the Bushwick neighborhood of Brooklyn, and in Queens, Aristizabal said that they have visited those areas but could not confirm that there have been any ICE actions there.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe have a team looking through different areas of Queens today where different people said they saw some people that looked differently than the Police Department but no one was able to confirm if they are or not ICE,\u201d Aristizabal said.\u000a\u000aOshiro praised the leadership of Congresswoman Nydia Velazquez and Congressman Jerry Nadler when they went to John F. Kennedy International Airport to push for the release of 11 individuals being held at Terminal 4 due to Trump\u2019s ban on travel from seven majority Muslim Nations. Such actions, he asserted, have been \u201cproductive and good in the eyes of the community.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWe feel that elected officials overall should stand with immigrants and should make that their voices heard on these issues,\u201d Oshiro said. \u201cWe encourage elected officials and work with elected officials to make sure that they are speaking out for affected communities.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe said that the organization has been in touch with Mayor Bill de Blasio and other elected officials to how the city and the state will \u201cmove forward under this new reality we are seeing.\u201d De Blasio has promised that New York City would remain a sanctuary city, but has expressed openness to adding additional offenses to the list of 170 over which the city cooperates with ICE.\u000a\u000a\u201cI would just say that you know while this has been going for several weeks now these kinds of raids that we\u2019ve been hearing we are also trying to figure out what is happening exactly,\u201d Oshiro continued. \u201cWe felt that in Staten Island, it was very clear\u2026there has been ramped up enforcements on Staten Island.\u201d\u000a\u000aEric Phillips, the mayor\u2019s spokesman, seemed to confirm that the raids took place.\u000a\u000aThese appear to be credible reports. Mayor is closely monitoring, along w/ NYPD. https://t.co/0ef0aztL0Q \u2014 Eric Phillips (@EricFPhillips) February 11, 2017\u000a\u000aHe also said that the mayor\u2019s office is looking into \u201cearlier reports from Bushwick.\u201d\u000a\u000aRosemary Boeglin, a mayoral spokeswoman, said that the city will continue to support the nearly 40 percent of New Yorkers who are foreign-born\u2014both documented and undocumented. Roughly half a million residents of the five boroughs are believed to be undocumented.\u000a\u000aShe also said that the city officials, including the NYPD, would not question individuals about their immigration status, nor will the NYPD transform into immigration enforcement agents.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe mayor\u2019s office has received credible reports of immigration enforcement activity in several New York City neighborhoods in the last few days,\u201d Boeglin said in a statement. \u201cThe mayor is closely monitoring the situation and the administration is working with NYPD and community organizations to verify the activity as we receive reports.\u201d\u000a\u000aGov. Andrew Cuomo\u2019s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Such actions, he asserted, have been &#8220;productive and good in the eyes of the community.&#8221;</p>\u000a<p>&#8220;We feel that elected officials overall should stand with immigrants and should make that their voices heard on these issues,&#8221; Oshiro&#160;said. &#8220;We encourage elected officials and work with elected officials to make sure that they are speaking out for affected communities.&#8221;</p>\u000a<p>He said that the organization has been in touch with Mayor Bill de Blasio and other elected officials to how the city and the state will &#8220;move forward under this new reality we are seeing.&#8221; De Blasio has promised that New York City would remain a sanctuary city, but has expressed openness to adding additional offenses to the list of 170 over which the city cooperates with ICE.</p>\u000a<p>&#8220;I would just say that you know while this has been going for several weeks now these kinds of raids that we&#8217;ve been hearing we are also trying to figure out what is happening exactly,&#8221; Oshiro continued. &#8220;We felt that in Staten Island,&#160;it was very clear&#8230;there has been ramped up enforcements&#160;on Staten Island.&#8221;</p>\u000a<p>Eric Phillips, the mayor&#8217;s spokesman, seemed to confirm that the raids took place.</p>\u000a<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\u000a<p lang="en" dir="ltr">These appear to be credible reports.

VSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\u000a\u000aChancellor Angela Merkel is setting aside \u20ac90m (£76m) in taxpayers\u2019 money to create a fund which will pay migrants to withdraw their asylum applications and leave Germany voluntarily.\u000a\u000aThe handouts will form part of a 16-point plan to speed up the removal of rejected asylum seekers, after Tunisian migrant Anis Amri murdered a Polish lorry driver, hijacked his vehicle and drove it into a Christmas market in Berlin while awaiting deportation.\u000a\u000aSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\u000a\u000aU.S. president Donald Trump told The Times that Merkel made a \u201ccatastrophic mistake\u201d when she opened the doors to an unlimited number of migrants in 2015. Her vice-chancellor, Sigmar Gabriel, later admitted that his superior had underestimated how difficult it would be to integrate migrants on such a grand scale, and that Germany had been plunged into a kulturkampf, or \u201ccultural war\u201d, as a result.\u000a\u000aGermany rejected 170,000 asylum claims in 2016 but, according to the Mail, just 26,000 were repatriated. 55,000 more decided to leave voluntarily \u2013 apparently leaving 81,000 bogus applicants unaccounted for.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe rely heavily on voluntary departures,\u201d admitted Chancellor Merkel, who was announcing the package after falling behind the Social Democrats in polls for Germany\u2019s upcoming elections.\u000a\u000aMartin Schulz, the former President of the European Parliament who has been nominated as the Social Democrat challenger to Merkel, said he backed the proposals to speed up deportations.\u000a\u000aSchulz has previously insisted that \u201cthe people who are arriving [in Europe] are refugees who have been threatened [and] we should welcome them\u201d \u2013 a statement which is at odds with the Vice-President of the European Commission\u2019s admission that at least 60 per cent are economic migrants.\u000a\u000aAs a leading figure in the European Union, Schulz was a strong supporter of the compulsory migrant quotas. These were forced through by the bloc despite strong opposition from central and eastern European member-states, which did not agree with Germany\u2019s unilateral decision to throw open the borders.\u000a\u000aSchulz hit out strongly at these countries in 2015, accusing them of \u201cnational egotism in its purest form\u201d.\u000a\u000aPolish interior minister Mariusz Blaszczak described at Schulz\u2019s words as \u201can example of German arrogance\u201d.

In some cases it means that the city government will be breaking federal law by assisting illegal aliens to evade apprehension by the feds. And, for the record: The 1996 IIRIRA (Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996) confirms that local police can enforce federal immigration laws and makes it illegal for a mayor or police chief to prevent their officers from contacting immigration officials about a person\u2019s immigration status.\u000a\u000aBut let\u2019s be honest, while the pro-mass immigration and illegal alien supporters are trying to turn this issue into a modern civil rights movement (MLK, Jr. and Caesar Chavez must be spinning in their respective graves) most of what drives the current sanctuary movement is\u2026sanctimony. And that sanctimony has a cost to the community, its citizens and by extension to the nation.\u000a\u000aOne cost we thankfully won\u2019t pay is the murder of soldiers in New Jersey by the Ft. Dix Radical Islamic Terror Cell who benefited by the sanctimony, excuse me, sanctuary cities who did not report them to the feds even one of the 19 times they could have. No, the city didn\u2019t help catch them, an alert store clerk tipped off the feds that led to their capture.\u000a\u000aSanctuary cities attract illegal aliens and the criminal aliens who know they can hide out in the alien communities with much less of a chance of detection and apprehension. It is obvious to everyone except, it seems, the city officials who must be so blinded by sanctimony that they don\u2019t see the cause and effect of calling their city a sanctuary.\u000a\u000aThis Sanctuary City movement provides us with a great experiment that we could never hope or want to set up as a test. But, since they do exist, they can provide us important data. Obviously they attract more illegal aliens and population increases.\u000a\u000aOther question we can ask:\u000a\u000aWhich city has more crime, including violent alien gangs, sanctuary cities or cities that enforce the law, all laws including immigration laws?\u000a\u000aWhich city has better schools and higher student test scores?\u000a\u000aWhich city\u2019s emergency rooms are flooded with non-paying illegal aliens and which city reports more exotic diseases to the Center for Disease Control?\u000a\u000aWhich city suffers from overpopulation with the attending urban blight, higher taxes, middle class flight and the ultimate erosion of the tax base?\u000a\u000aWhich cities serve as hideouts for murdering terrorists who know they can rely on the sanctimony of local elected officials to look that other way while they plan their murderous acts?\u000a\u000aNo sane person would want to subject citizens to such an experiment because the results are so predictably terrible.

VThe immigrant advocacy group Make the Road New York said Saturday night that five men on Staten Island were detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents this week.\u000a\u000aIt is unclear what led to them being detained.\u000a\u000aMayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s office released a statement, saying it has "received credible reports of immigration enforcement activity in several New York City neighborhoods in the last few days. The Mayor is closely monitoring the situation and the Administration is working with NYPD and community organizations to verify the activity as we receive reports."\u000a\u000aImmigration officials put out their own statement that says "ICE regularly conducts targeted enforcement operations during which additional resources and personnel are dedicated to apprehending deportable foreign nationals. The focus of these operations is no different than the routine, targeted arrests carried out by ICE\u2019s Fugitive Operations Teams on a daily basis."\u000a\u000aCity Hall officials are reminding New Yorkers that city officials and members of the NYPD will never ask about their immigration status.\u000a\u000aThe New York Immigration Coalition estimates there are 500,000 people living in New York City illegally \u2014 and many more with green cards that, they say, fear deportation.\u000a\u000a"There is a factor of fear in the communities, but we\u2019re trying to make sure that we provide the right information, that we provide a space for them to come forward if they hear [of] or are victims of it, and make sure that people are prepared,\u201d said Gonzalo Mercado. Mercado heads heads La Colmena, which works with the immigrant community on Staten Island.\u000a\u000aThe news of the five men being detained came hours after hundreds of people rallied at Washington Square Park, calling on police to stop arresting undocumented immigrants for low-level crimes that may get them deported.

Follow us on Facebook This is highly interesting. But it goes without saying.Sponsored Links\u000a\u000aRick Oltman,\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWith many American cities now declaring themselves so-called sanctuaries for illegal aliens it is time to examine this phenomenon and highlight its costs and predict where it will eventually lead.\u000a\u000a\u201cSanctuary City\u201d with regard to illegal immigration is a generic term that is used haphazardly and carelessly by elected officials, usually without input or approval from the citizens, to declare that the city will not support federal law enforcement officers in the enforcement of the nation\u2019s immigration laws. In some cases it means that the city government will be breaking federal law by assisting illegal aliens to evade apprehension by the feds. And, for the record: The 1996 IIRIRA (Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996) confirms that local police can enforce federal immigration laws and makes it illegal for a mayor or police chief to prevent their officers from contacting immigration officials about a person\u2019s immigration status.\u000a\u000aBut let\u2019s be honest, while the pro-mass immigration and illegal alien supporters are trying to turn this issue into a modern civil rights movement (MLK, Jr. and Caesar Chavez must be spinning in their respective graves) most of what drives the current sanctuary movement is\u2026sanctimony. And that sanctimony has a cost to the community, its citizens and by extension to the nation.\u000a\u000aOne cost we thankfully won\u2019t pay is the murder of soldiers in New Jersey by the Ft. Dix Radical Islamic Terror Cell who benefited by the sanctimony, excuse me, sanctuary cities who did not report them to the feds even one of the 19 times they could have. No, the city didn\u2019t help catch them, an alert store clerk tipped off the feds that led to their capture.\u000a\u000aSanctuary cities attract illegal aliens and the criminal aliens who know they can hide out in the alien communities with much less of a chance of detection and apprehension. It is obvious to everyone except, it seems, the city officials who must be so blinded by sanctimony that they don\u2019t see the cause and effect of calling their city a sanctuary.\u000a\u000aThis Sanctuary City movement provides us with a great experiment that we could never hope or want to set up as a test. But, since they do exist, they can provide us important data. Obviously they attract more illegal aliens and population increases.\u000a\u000aOther question we can ask:\u000a\u000aWhich city has more crime, including violent alien gangs, sanctuary cities or cities that enforce the law, all laws including immigration laws?\u000a\u000aWhich city has better schools and higher student test scores?\u000a\u000aWhich city\u2019s emergency rooms are flooded with non-paying illegal aliens and which city reports more exotic diseases to the Center for Disease Control?\u000a\u000aWhich city suffers from overpopulation with the attending urban blight, higher taxes, middle class flight and the ultimate erosion of the tax base?\u000a\u000aWhich cities serve as hideouts for murdering terrorists who know they can rely on the sanctimony of local elected officials to look that other way while they plan their murderous acts?\u000a\u000aNo sane person would want to subject citizens to such an experiment because the results are so predictably terrible. But, thoughtless city officials are now sentencing their constituents with overcrowding, crime and disease, so let\u2019s learn what we can.\u000a\u000ahttp://www.capsweb.org/opinion-releases/cost-sanctuary-cities\u000a\u000aTG Facebook Comments

Dix Radical Islamic Terror Cell who benefited by the sanctimony, excuse me, sanctuary cities who did not report them to the feds even one of the 19 times they could have.&#160; No, the city didn&#8217;t help catch them, an alert store clerk tipped off the feds that led to their capture.</p>\u000a<p>Sanctuary cities attract illegal aliens and the criminal aliens who know they can hide out in the alien communities with much less of a chance of detection and apprehension.&#160; It is obvious to everyone except, it seems, the city officials who must be so blinded by sanctimony that they don&#8217;t see the cause and effect of calling their city a sanctuary.</p>\u000a<p>This Sanctuary City movement provides us with a great experiment that we could never hope or want to set up as a test.&#160; But, since they do exist, they can provide us important data.&#160; Obviously they attract more illegal aliens and population increases.</p>\u000a<p>Other question we can ask:</p>\u000a<ul>\u000a<li>Which city has more crime, including violent alien gangs, sanctuary cities or cities that enforce the law, all laws including immigration laws?</li>\u000a<li>Which city has better schools and higher student test scores?</li>\u000a<li>Which city&#8217;s emergency rooms are flooded with non-paying illegal aliens and which city reports more exotic diseases to the Center for Disease Control?</li>\u000a<li>Which city suffers from overpopulation with the attending urban blight, higher taxes, middle class flight and the ultimate erosion of the tax base?</li>\u000a<li>Which cities serve as hideouts for murdering terrorists who know they can rely on the sanctimony of local elected officials to look that other way while they plan their murderous acts?</li>\u000a</ul>\u000a<p><a href="http://www.capsweb.org/opinion-releases/cost-sanctuary-cities">No sane person would want to subject citizens to such an experiment because the results are so predictably terrible.&#160; But, thoughtless city officials are now sentencing their constituents with overcrowding, crime and disease, so let&#8217;s learn what we can.&#160; &#160;</a></p>\u000a<p>&#160;</p>\u000a<p>http://www.capsweb.org/opinion-releases/cost-sanctuary-cities</p>\u000a<p>&#160;</p>\u000a<p>&#160;</p>\u000a \u000a<p id="2419672" class="os_poll"></p>\u000a<p class="fb-social-plugin fb-post"></p>\u000a<h3> TG Facebook Comments</h3>   </div>

He had hemophilia, a blood-clotting disease that meant he needed to get blood transfusions all through his childhood. In the 1980s, HIV was a new disease and no one yet knew to screen donated blood. Ryan White was one of the first people in the US to talk openly about having HIV and became famous in the US and all over the world. He bravely fought to educate others about HIV and against the stigma and discrimination HIV-positive people often face.\u000a\u000aIn 1984, Ryan\u2019s high school in Kokomo, Indiana, learned about his status. They refused to let him return to the school for fear that he would infect other students. Ryan was only allowed to participate in classroom activities by telephone. His family fought the superintendent\u2019s decision in court and Ryan was able to return to school after a judge ruled in his favor. He was tormented when he returned to school. Students frequently insulted him and wrote degrading statements on his locker. His family faced discrimination as well. Store clerks refused to hand his mother change because they didn\u2019t want to touch her. Restaurants threw away plates and silverware after the White family ate there.

While the rest of NYC\u2019s business leaders stuck with the traditional male hiarchy, Trump broke ground multiple times when he saw talent that reached across gender lines. Now it\u2019s apparent his white house team will be no different. His first pick is a woman who made history as the first female to successfully run a presidential campaign, against a vicious media at that.\u000a\u000aKellyanne Conway was named Donald Trump\u2019s campaign manager Aug. 17, making her the first woman to ever run a Republican presidential campaign. She\u2019s traveled with Trump throughout his campaign in its last months and advised him, as well as appeared frequently on TV to speak on his behalf.\u000a\u000aBikers arrive in DC: will you be there?\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aSponsored Links\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWant more?

In fact, she was already doing this for the Trump campaign before he tapped her to be his campaign manager.\u000a\u000aConway graduated magna cum laude from Trinity College in Washington, D.C., earning a degree in political science.\u000a\u000aConway met Trump in 2006, when she was living in one of his buildings, according to the Washington Post. She even served on the condo board of the Trump World Tower in Manhattan. Trump, she told the Post, was surprisingly hands on, even showing up to meetings to hear residents\u2019 concerns. Over the years, the Post continued, Trump would call her to say he\u2019d seen her on TV and ask her opinion on a topic.\u000a\u000aTrump\u2019s second pick is none other than billionaire innovator Peter thiel, a gay Republican and business genius. Peter, an immigrant from Austria, helped create PayPal, then using the money to invest and fund ideas he saw as having potent l to shape the future. He invested in a young Facebook when he so it\u2019s potential, and we all see how that turned out.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aPeter is going to be perfect for bringing the outside insight trump needs to restart American industry.\u000a\u000aThe third pick needs no introduction.

His mother was raised in Tennessee in a very large family and dropped out of school in the third grade. With limited prospects in life, she married Baptist minister and factory worker Robert Carson when she was 13. The couple moved to Detroit and had two children. But Sonya eventually discovered her husband was a bigamist and had another secret family. The two divorced, with Robert going to live with his other family and thus leaving Sonya and her children financially devastated.\u000a\u000aBen was 8 and Curtis, his brother, was 10 when Sonya began to raise them as a single mother, reportedly moving to Boston to live with her sister for a time and eventually returning to Detroit. The family was very poor and to make ends meet Sonya sometimes toiled at two or three jobs simultaneously in order to provide for her boys. Most of the jobs she had was as a domestic worker.As Carson later detailed in his autobiography, his mother was frugal with the family\u2019s finances, cleaning and patching clothes from the Goodwill in order to dress the boys. The family would also go to local farmers and offer to pick vegetables in exchange for a portion of the yield. Sonya would then can the produce for the kids\u2019 meals. Her actions, and the way she managed the family, proved to be a tremendous influence on Ben and Curtis.Sonya also taught her boys that anything was possible. By his recollection many years later, Carson had thoughts of a career in medicine. Because his family was on medical assistance, they would have to wait for hours to be seen by one of the interns at hospitals in Boston or Detroit. Ben would listen to the pulse of the hospital as doctors and nurses went about their routines, fantasizing that one day they\u2019d be calling for a \u201cDr. Carson.\u201d\u000a\u000aTG Facebook Comments

Now he\u2019s putting his game to work.\u000a\u000aThe president spent his Saturday morning golfing with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe as he hosts his first foreign leader at his winter estate in Palm Beach, Florida.\u000a\u000aSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\u000a\u000aAfter a rocky diplomatic start that included contentious phone calls with the leaders of Mexico and Australia, the friendly weekend of meetings, dinners and golf suggests the new president is willing to invest time in developing close personal relationships with leaders he feels he can work with.\u000a\u000aTrump and Abe left Mar-a-Lago early Saturday morning and headed north to one of Trump\u2019s golf courses in Jupiter, Florida. Reporters weren\u2019t able to catch a glimpse of the pair as they played on the 285-acre property. But Trump later posted a photo of them giving each other a high-five on the golf course and tweeted, \u201cHaving a great time hosting Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in the United States!\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Trump National Golf Club website, in typical Trumpian language, claims the course \u201cfeatures the finest revetted bunkers in the United States, incredible water hazards, including a magnificent island green, and one of the most picturesque landscapes, all of which make for a truly memorable round.\u201d\u000a\u000aAbe had joked at a joint press conference at the White House on Friday that he was looking forward to playing golf with Trump, even though he\u2019s not nearly as good with a club.\u000a\u000aHe said he planned to use the time to discuss the future of the world, the Pacific region and U.S.-Japanese relations.\u000a\u000aAs their husbands golfed, Melania Trump and Akie Abe toured the Morikami Museum and Japanese Gardens in nearby Delray Beach. The women were also expected to have lunch together at Mar-a-Lago.\u000a\u000aThe two couples touched down in Florida on Friday afternoon and headed straight to Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago Club, where they enjoyed a late dinner at its crowded patio restaurant. They were joined by Robert Kraft, the owner of the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots, and several interpreters. Paying members and club guests took in the scene and mingled with Trump and Abe into the night.\u000a\u000aThe president and Mrs. Trump planned to host a more formal delegation dinner with the Abes on Saturday night.\u000a\u000aTrump also was expected to tend to other business in Florida: calling Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi and Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos as he continues conversations with foreign leaders.\u000a\u000aTrump and Abe appear to have hit it off early. Abe was the only world leader to meet with Trump before his inauguration, and Trump welcomed Abe to the White House with a hug.\u000a\u000aAs a candidate, Trump often railed against former President Barack Obama for his frequent golfing, claiming Obama played more often than players on the PGA Tour.\u000a\u000aHe said if he won he\u2019d likely be too busy to golf and would only play with people he was looking to make deals with.\u000a\u000aOne of Trump\u2019s first actions as president was to withdraw the U.S. from a 12-nation, trans-Pacific trade agreement that was negotiated by the Obama administration and strongly supported by Tokyo.\u000a\u000aAbe has said that Japan may be open to a bilateral trade deal with the U.S., but reaching such a deal would be political difficult. Japan logged the second largest trade surplus with the U.S. last year.

V(Natural News) Another riot broke out on another university campus last Wednesday night as haters of law and order egged on by co-conspirator journo-terrorists in the media destroyed public and private property and attacked supporters of President Donald J. Trump, beating at least one man unconscious.\u000a\u000aAs you\u2019re likely aware by now, domestic terrorists \u2013 let\u2019s not call them \u201cprotesters\u201d because that\u2019s not what they are \u2013 shut down a planned event featuring Trump supporter and Breitbart senior editor Milo Yiannopoulos, setting fires, smashing windows, and using steel pipes to beat several people before police moved in.\u000a\u000aHowever, the terrorism didn\u2019t end there, as reported by the San Francisco Chronicle:\u000a\u000aBut even after the event\u2019s cancellation, hundreds of protesters spilled off campus into the city streets, where the violence continued as they confronted drivers, engaged in fights, smashed storefront windows and set fires.\u000a\u000aIn the past, such terrorism has been staged by groups funded by billionaire anarchist George Soros, a Nazi collaborator who has literally taken over the Democratic Party. What\u2019s more, Democrats don\u2019t seem to mind; while they compare Trump to a Nazi, Democratic leaders are in bed with someone who actually helped them. (RELATED: Keep track of who\u2019s behind the collapse of our society at Terrorism.news)\u000a\u000aAs noted by the Gateway Pundit, Soros\u2019 filthy hands are all over the anti-Trump, anti-GOP violence in recent months:\u000a\u000aA week before last Soros was reported as being behind 50 Groups involved in the \u2018Women\u2019s Protests\u2019 the day after the inauguration.\u000a\u000aBefore that Soros groups were reportedly being used by social media giants to combat \u2018Fake News\u2019. These groups will use the Soros funded website Snopes which is notorious for its far left leaning positions on all issues related to politics. The result of these efforts will be more far left news supported by the Nazi collaborator.\u000a\u000aBefore this, Soros was connected to the groups demanding the recounts after the November 8th election. And at about the same time, Soros money was funding protests shortly after the election results were official.\u000a\u000aThen, of course, there is the pathetic, co-conspirator media, which gives a platform to left-wing hate-mongers spewing all kinds of crazy, disgusting things that, were Barack Obama still in office, would have been treated as nothing less than treason (and why isn\u2019t he speaking out against all of this violence?).\u000a\u000aFor instance, little-watched MSNBC put Hillary Clinton\u2019s vice presidential pick, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, on the air and let him say this, unchallenged, about the Democratic anti-Trump \u201cstrategy\u201d moving forward:\u000a\u000aWhat we\u2019ve got to do is fight in Congress, fight in the courts, fight in the streets, fight online, fight at the ballot box, and now there\u2019s the momentum to be able to do this. And we\u2019re not afraid of the popular outcry, we\u2019re energized by it and that\u2019s going to help us do our job and do it better.\u000a\u000aThen, Foreign Policy published this unhinged screed from a former State Department \u201csenior advisor,\u201d Rosa Brooks, who actually suggested a military coup to remove Trump from office. Claiming Trump is \u201ccrazy,\u201d she implores us to read the 25th Amendment to the Constitution, which gives instruction on how to remove a president from office that has been deemed unfit.\u000a\u000aAnd why is Trump unfit? Because the angry Left has proclaimed it so! And just look at what he\u2019s doing to the country!\u000a\u000aWho\u2019s the real lunatic here? I say it\u2019s a former government \u201cadvisor\u201d who recommends the military overthrow a duly elected U.S. president, as if we were a banana republic. (RELATED: The angry Left won\u2019t stop until the civil society is destroyed \u2013 stay tuned at Collapse.news)\u000a\u000aThat any media outlet would even give someone a platform to suggest war in the streets and a military coup to remove our president proves once again that journo-terrorists are working hand in hand with actual terrorists funded by a real Nazi sympathizer to destroy civil rights.\u000a\u000aHere is what the \u201ctolerant\u201d Left is really like:\u000a\u000aJ.D. Heyes is a senior writer for Natural News and News Target, as well as editor of The National Sentinel.\u000a\u000aSources:\u000a\u000aNaturalNews.com\u000a\u000aForeignPolicy.com\u000a\u000aBreitbart.com\u000a\u000aTheNationalSentinel.com\u000a\u000aGoodGopher.com

VThe adhesives used on fruit and vegetable stickers are regulated by the FDA. They are labeled as \u201cindirect food-contact substances.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhat chemicals the glue can be made from are listed in the Code of Federal Regulations part 175.125. The same rules apply to adhesives for both organic and conventional produce.\u000a\u000aFor any food-contact substance to be approved, the FDA considers its composition, the amount a consumer might eat, short and long-term health effects, and any other safety factors. The FDA then sets a threshold at a lower level than what one would be expect to have any adverse effect from. They still advise washing fruits and vegetables before eating them.\u000a\u000aWhy is that do you suppose?\u000a\u000aEver wondered what IS actually in that glue?\u000a\u000aFruits and vegetables have a skin, much like humans do. It is porous and absorbs things that are sprayed onto it or adhered to it.\u000a\u000aThink of nicotine and birth control patches. You stick them to your arm and it absorbs systemically\u2026 These stickers may very well be doing the same thing to our produce\u2026. So what exactly are they sticking to our food?\u000a\u000aIn turn, after a little research, it seems what they are really doing is sticking it to all of us.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aCheck this out: This is the list of approved adhesive/glue ingredients that can be used on produce here in the USA.\u000a\u000aTrisodium \u2013 Corrosive when ingested.\u000a\u000aTurpentine \u2013 Completely toxic when ingested.\u000a\u000aUrea-formaldehyde resins \u2013 Rapid absorption, extremely toxic\u000a\u000aStyrene Maleic anhydride \u2013 Non-surgical method of male sterilization\u000a\u000aPetroleum \u2013 Highly toxic when ingested\u000a\u000aSynthetic paraffin \u2013 Toxic when ingested\u000a\u000aXylene \u2013 In higher levels Xylene can cause progressive inhibition of nervous system function, culminating in coma, respiratory depression and ultimately death from cerebral anoxia.

And do you really trust the FDA? A little bit of poison cumulatively over time adds up. None of these items are things I personally care to ingest.\u000a\u000aThe best way to wash your fruits and vegetables:\u000a\u000aStep 1. Soak in Vinegar and water for 10 minutes.\u000a\u000aStep 2.

VConsumer confidence might be higher than it has been in a long time following the election of Donald Trump as President-Elect, but the current state of the economy isn\u2019t too reassuring to many retirement-age Americans. Many aging \u201cBaby Boomers\u201d are deciding to retire across the border and even overseas to enjoy a better quality of life than they otherwise could stateside, as cost of living, access to healthcare, and various other factors are apparently better in many other countries than they are here in the United States.\u000a\u000aAccording to the latest statistics, more Americans than ever before are retiring outside the U.S. \u2014 some 17 percent more between 2010 and 2015 compared to years prior. Almost 400,000 American retirees now reside abroad, says the Social Security Administration (SSA), with the most popular destination options being Canada, Japan, Mexico, Germany, and the United Kingdom.\u000a\u000aThe most common reason cited for choosing someplace other than America is cost of living, according to University of Pennsylvania Pension Research Council director Olivia S. Mitchell. After working hard all their lives, she says, American retirees who are still able want to explore, experience, and enjoy \u2014 at the lowest possible cost, as many are on fixed pensions or retirement incomes.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think that many people retire when they are in good health and they are interested in stretching their dollars and seeing the world,\u201d Mitchell told ABC News about this growing phenomenon, which has been made possible in large part due to the growth of the internet and the ever-increasing mobile culture that allows folks to travel and live other places while still staying connected to their loved ones.\u000a\u000aLower cost of living is great, but what about language and cultural barriers?\u000a\u000aCost of living encompasses many factors, including rent, utility costs, property values, and taxes. In countries like Mexico, for instance, land and homes can be purchased for considerably less than in the U.S., especially due to a favorable exchange rate, and property taxes are minimal. This means that retirees can take their American retirement incomes and live much better than they could in the U.S.\u000a\u000aHiring workers to do chores and other manual labor is also cheaper in many other countries, which is particularly appealing to aging folks who know that they\u2019re only going to become increasingly less able to do what they could in their younger years. For folks like now-widowed Kay McCowen, having extra help around the house at a lower cost was a no-brainer, not to mention a warmer climate.\u000a\u000a\u201cI wanted to find a place where I could afford to live off my Social Security,\u201d McCowen, who now resides in Mexico, told ABC News. \u201cThe weather here is so perfect, and it\u2019s a beautiful place.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut not everything is rosy when it comes to emigrating elsewhere during one\u2019s retirement years. In most other countries, the language barrier alone can make it difficult to perform routine duties like buying groceries, getting a car repaired, receiving proper medical care, or even conversing with neighbors. Consequently, it can be difficult to assimilate into a new culture, which can create feelings of isolation and loneliness.\u000a\u000aOn the flip side, the retirement years allow elderly folks more time than ever to learn a new language, for instance, and engage in new experiences \u2014 and in many cases, they end up living around other retirees who are in a similar position of wanting to make new friends and meld into a new culture, which for some is actually better than what they currently have in the U.S.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe have a real strong sense of security here,\u201d a man by the name of Joseph Roginski, who retired to Japan in 2011, told ABC News about his experience in eastern Asia. \u201cI can leave my door unlocked and no one will take anything. When I go to another country I feel nervous, but when I come back I feel like I\u2019m home.\u201d\u000a\u000aSources:\u000a\u000aABCNews.Go.com\u000a\u000aCSMonitor.com

For folks like now-widowed Kay McCowen, having extra help around the house at a lower cost was a no-brainer, not to mention a warmer climate.</p>\u000a<p>&#8220;I wanted to find a place where I could afford to live off my Social Security,&#8221; McCowen, who now resides in Mexico, told <i>ABC News</i>. &#8220;The weather here is so perfect, and it&#8217;s a beautiful place.&#8221;</p>\u000a<p>But not everything is rosy when it comes to <a href="http://science.naturalnews.com/emigration.html" target="_blank">emigrating elsewhere</a> during one&#8217;s retirement years. In most other countries, the language barrier alone can make it difficult to perform routine duties like buying groceries, getting a car repaired, receiving proper medical care, or even conversing with neighbors. Consequently, it can be difficult to assimilate into a new culture, which can create feelings of isolation and loneliness.</p>\u000a<p>On the flip side, the retirement years allow elderly folks more time than ever to learn a new language, for instance, and engage in new experiences &#8212; and in many cases, they end up living around other retirees who are in a similar position of wanting to make new friends and meld into a new culture, which for some is actually better than what they currently have in the U.S.</p>\u000a<p>&#8220;We have a real strong sense of security here,&#8221; a man by the name of Joseph Roginski, who retired to Japan in 2011, told <i>ABC News</i> about his experience in eastern Asia. &#8220;I can leave my door unlocked and no one will take anything. When I go to another country I feel nervous, but when I come back I feel like I&#8217;m home.&#8221;</p>\u000a<p><b>Sources:</b></p>\u000a<p><a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/growing-number-americans-retiring-us-44427279" target="_blank">ABCNews.Go.com</a></p>\u000a<p><a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Society/2016/1227/Why-are-more-Americans-retiring-abroad" target="_blank">CSMonitor.com</a></p>\u000a\u000a \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a<p id="mc_embed_signup">\u000a \u000a</p>\u000a<p></p>\u000a<p></p>\u000a<p></p>\u000a</div>

VLife is a highly complex and challenging concept. People deal with life in different ways, and they end up in very different places for that. In reverse, you can be sure that there are also a lot of people that find themselves in the same situation, because we\u2019re all different, but not very different at the same time, if that makes sense.\u000a\u000aOne aspect of life is how it tends to make us prone to stress accumulation. Depending on how well you\u2019ve made things for yourself in life, you can still be subject to stress and anxiety, and other similar symptoms that no one wants to have to deal with. If you are living a very successful life, there might be less frequent and less intense cases of stress accumulation, but that doesn\u2019t mean you are experiencing continuous bliss. Maybe you\u2019ve experienced a tragedy or have been witness to one, or maybe you are just having a really hard time lately when it comes to work.\u000a\u000aLike we\u2019ve said, you\u2019re never alone and despite how you might feel, there are a lot of people going through the same thing. Speaking of other people, one particular group of people you should focus on are your friends. You talk to them on a regular basis and do things together, but did you know you could actually do stuff with your friends that will help you overcome your not so cool mood or state of spirit?\u000a\u000aJoin us for the rest of this article, as we explore some of the things you can do with friends, and how you can make the most out of them to overcome the blues or rough period you\u2019re facing.\u000a\u000aAgriculture\u000a\u000aHave you ever considered gardening? A cool way to spend more time with your friends is by opening a garden together. It\u2019s up to you how big or small it would be, and what would grow inside. Gardening is a known form of reducing anxiety. Seeing things grow out of your own work and dedication can be very satisfying and rewarding for the mind and spirit. And vegetables don\u2019t grow instantly, so you can spend the time with friends while you\u2019re all tending to the garden. Bring a good book or some games and make the most of it.\u000a\u000aTraveling\u000a\u000aOne influential factor in stress and anxiety increase is spending too much time in one place. You need to get out of the house, get some fresh air, or maybe just change the scenery for a while. Get a car, pack some clothes, food and some clothes, and head to a location where you can all relax in each other\u2019s company. Somewhere with a lot of sunlight, maybe, and a beach. Or maybe a snowy mountain with some skiing if that\u2019s more your thing.\u000a\u000aThat being said, it\u2019s important to know that when dealing with stress or anxiety, there\u2019s always a way out. And by engaging in these activities with your friends by your side, you can create stronger bonds and free your mind, all in the same experience. It wouldn\u2019t be a bad idea to immortalize the moment either. Pictures tend to last a long time, and having the possibility of revisiting that moment whenever you want is a great thing to have.\u000a\u000aAuthor byline:\u000a\u000aJohn Matthew working as digital marketing expert since 2008, he started his career as social media professional with NTD Telecommunications.

VThe BBC is determined to press ahead with plans to increase its coverage of more religions, and could even broadcast the Muslim call to Friday prayers, thanks to concerns from within the corporation that its religious broadcasting is too biased towards Christianity.\u000a\u000aArticle by Donna Rachel Edmunds\u000a\u000aLord Hall of Birkenhead, director-general of the corporation, will invite religious leaders to take part in discussions on increasing multi-faith coverage, following the publication of a BBC report which claimed that there was currently a disproportionate amount of Christian coverage, compared with other faiths.\u000a\u000aLord Hall is also set to appoint a senior executive to the board of governors with a remit to draw up new programme ideas to complement the corporation\u2019s current Christian output, The Times has reported. A BBC insider said that Lord Hall was determined to do more to more represent others.\u000a\u000a\u201cFaith is remarkably important. The BBC can and must do more to ensure that the important role faith plays is recognised and reflected in our programming,\u201d a source said.\u000a\u000aFor years the BBC has come under fire for being biased against Christians and towards members of other faiths, Islam in particular.\u000a\u000aA 2012 report by the New Culture Forum entitled \u2018A Question of Attitude \u2013 the BBC and Bias Beyond News\u2019 found that, while Christians were portrayed as laughable at best, violent extremists at worst by BBC programme-makers, the corporation went out of its way to paint Muslims, including Muslim extremists, in a moderate light.\u000a\u000aIn one example cited, a BBC drama depicted a peaceable Muslim being beheaded at the hands of Christian extremists.\u000a\u000aThe report noted: \u201cIt sometimes feels as if someone in the BBC has sent round a memo instructing programme makers to compensate for the negative publicity that inevitably attends the exposure of terrorist plots to murder large numbers of people by force-feeding the public whitewashed or positive images of Islam.\u000a\u000a\u201cThough no doubt well-meant, and carried out in the furtherance of community cohesion, this approach does not help moderate Muslims who have to contend with extremists, and risks nurturing suspicions of institutional bias.\u201d\u000a\u000aReligious leaders expected to be invited to the BBC\u2019s discussions include Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, Archbishop of Westminster Cardinal Vincent Nichols, and Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis.\u000a\u000aHarun Khan, the head of the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB), is also expected to attend as are Hindu and Sikh leaders.\u000a\u000aIbrahim Mogra of the MCB has suggested that the BBC could televise Friday prayers from a mosque, cover Eid, which marks the end of Ramadan, or show children attending Koranic lessons.\u000a\u000aThe move comes months after Aaqil Ahmed, former head of religion and ethics at the BBC, told a Commons committee that he had prepared a report for Lord Hall on the BBC\u2019s religious output across TV and radio, which he claimed was biased toward Christianity.\u000a\u000a\u201cChristianity remains the cornerstone of our output and there are more hours dedicated to it than there are to other faiths,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aIn response, Christian group A Voice for Justice launched a petition calling for Aaqil Amhed \u201cto be removed from office on the grounds of Islamic bias and clear disrespect for Christian belief\u201d.\u000a\u000aThe petition text reasoned: \u201cHe has regularly commissioned documentaries displaying clear pro-Islamic bias, while calling into question fundamental tenets and teachings of Christianity, in such a way as to trivialise and undermine Christian faith.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe UK is a Christian country [\u2026] our society [is] based upon Christian values.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is entirely right therefore that Christianity be given more airtime than the beliefs of minority groups, and that it should be treated with respect. In particular, Islam should not be singled out for special interest and presented as impliedly superior to Christianity.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe therefore call on Lord Hall as Director General of the BBC to reject this misguided and overtly anti-Christian proposal, and for Aaqil Ahmed\u2019s immediate removal from office.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe petition has been signed by more than 13,000 people to date.\u000a\u000aRead more at: breitbart.com

VCancer is Mainly Caused by The Intake of Acidic Food

VThe leading cause of cancer is the food we eat. A long time ago we consumed a diet of mainly alkaline food, but that has changed, and rate of cancer has increased. The majority doctors don\u2019t inform you on the correct food to eat to stay free of cancer and what to eat to cause the body to remove it naturally.\u000a\u000aThe Foods we eat in today\u2019s time contain both acid and alkalinizing forming elements. A diet of mainly acid-forming food can contribute to cancer. Unfortunately, that is a common diet here in the western culture. American\u2019s diet today is mostly acidic. If you are fighting cancer, you need to balance the body\u2019s pH level because cancer will thrive in an acidic environment whereas an alkaline environment will remove cancer.\u000a\u000aWe see more people with cancer today more than ever before, and it\u2019s because the typical western diet is far too high in acid-producing foods such as animal products which include dairy products.\u000a\u000aThe foods we used to eat like freshly grown fruit and vegetables were much better for us, so the best solution is to make some dietary changes. The alkaline-acid ratio is measured on the pH scale which ranges from 0 to 14 with 7 being neutral. The lower end of the scale which is from 0 to 7 is acidic, and anything between 7 to 14 is alkaline.\u000a\u000aThe easiest way to find out what foods are either alkaline or acidic is to research which foods are alkaline or acidic more so than others, also test your alkaline level often. While a diagnosis of cancer may have other contributing factors, the food we eat now is the main cause.\u000a\u000aMany years ago before we had supermarkets we were eating a healthier diet, now because of processed foods and the popularity of fast food outlets our diets have changed. A diet of food from an acidic range is causing many health problems now, and cancer is just one of them. For instance, many of our foods are refined, and most of our bread and other baked foods are made from refined white flour.\u000a\u000aSome other examples of acid forming foods are; pasta, cheese, ice cream and butter, jams and jellies, alcohol and soft drinks. All acid forming foods are not necessarily bad; it\u2019s just our diet is out of balance, and if you are dealing with any serious health problem it\u2019s essential to look carefully at what you are eating.\u000a\u000aSome of the alkaline foods are fresh fruit and nearly all freshly grown vegetables. Also consuming, nuts, seeds, grains and legumes are all alkaline foods. It\u2019s important to remember that the changes you make to a more alkaline diet have many health benefits including removing cancer naturally.\u000a\u000aWhile cancer has some other contributing factors, the most important cause is what we eat, because our health is directly related to our dietary choices. Our diet has changed over the last 40 to 70 years, and most of what we eat now is available in supermarkets and supermarkets have an overwhelming influence on what we now buy.\u000a\u000aMuch of what\u2019s available in supermarkets is processed, and because of it, this food is low in nutritional value, and that is without question the reason why there is so much cancer now. It makes a lot of sense if you are dealing with cancer that the first and the most important change you make is with your diet and that you select from a more alkaline range. Also, make sure it\u2019s fresh and if all possible that it is organic.\u000a\u000ahttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2754915/\u000a\u000ahttp://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/why-alkaline-approach-can-successfully-treat-cancer?page=2#_edn6\u000a\u000ahttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19746253

VBefore you get into this article, note that I\u2019m marking it \u201csatire.\u201d Yet none of the themes unveiled here are actually funny. This is serious stuff\u2026 it\u2019s just that 99.9% of humanity isn\u2019t ready to cognitively grasp what I\u2019m about to present here, so until people are more ready to face the reality of demonic evil in our world, I\u2019m going to label all this a weekend joke. Funny, isn\u2019t it? If it\u2019s too much for you, don\u2019t take it too seriously. The NFL is a joke anyway, right?\u000a\u000aThe average Superbowl viewer is so totally clueless about reality that they have no idea what they\u2019re even watching. Over the last several years, the NFL has slowly given way to the agenda of truly evil globalists, pushing quack science fraud (breast cancer \u201cawareness\u201d propaganda), anti-American hatred (Colin Kaepernick\u2019s nauseating antics), cultural subversion agendas and vulgar halftime shows that frequently invoke Satanic imagery in ritualistic fashion (see the multitude of photos and videos below for proof).\u000a\u000aBut those assaults on the human psyche are nothing compared to the \u201cbig agenda\u201d of using the Superbowl halftime platform. I realize this may be hard for people to grasp if they aren\u2019t informed about the deeper layers of wretched evil that have infested our world \u2014 the pizza shop pedophile stories barely scratch the surface \u2014 but the real purpose of the Superbowl halftime show is to ritualistically celebrate the power of Satan right in the open, declaring his dominion over the Earth by glorifying his imagery, words and worship on national television.\u000a\u000aSuperbowl halftime shows are saturated with symbols of demonic rituals and Satan worship\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIf you\u2019re not aware that this has been happening throughout Superbowl halftime shows in years past, you are wildly uninformed about the depth and brashness of the Satanic symbolism shoved right in your face during every Superbowl \u201cindoctrination\u201d ritual. The symbols are irrefutably Satanic and linked to Illuminati agendas of human sacrifice, occult power and dominion of the minds of the masses.

That\u2019s why Pope Francis blessed this year\u2019s NFL broadcast for the first time ever: He\u2019s a globalist plant, run by demonic forces who carried out a Vatican coup to replace Pope Benedict with an evil \u201cglobalist Pope\u201d who would follow the bidding of Satan. (How\u2019s that for a satirical synopsis of the most recent Vatican conspiracy?)\u000a\u000aHe selected this year\u2019s Superbowl for special blessings, obviously knowing in advance that he would be invoking the power of the Vatican to bless one of the most Satanic, demonic live Satan-worshipping ceremonies ever broadcast.\u000a\u000aIt began with Lady Gaga being lowered into a red fiery platform on cables (i.e. descending into Hell), then dancing in a way that depicted her as a puppet on \u201cpuppet strings\u201d (indicating she\u2019s a puppet of Satan):\u000a\u000aHere\u2019s a depiction of a female succubus from Anime, showing the sexual seduction of deceptive female Hell minions who lure you into surrendering your soul:\u000a\u000aAnd here\u2019s how Lady Gaga depicted herself in a crotch-centric seduction dance while wearing eye makeup that almost perfectly matches the female succubus above:\u000a\u000aCheck out the uncanny resemblance:\u000a\u000aNote the similarity of her almost \u201chorned shoulders\u201d with depictions of the female succubus, a minion of Hell:\u000a\u000aLady Gaga even carries her own \u201cpower staff\u201d based on a very precise geometry, as is frequently depicted by Hellish minions who wield power over the souls of others:\u000a\u000aAs she\u2019s singing, reddish Hell-like fire consumes the stage around her, from which red-colored \u201chorns\u201d of the owl symbolism are repeated throughout: (the \u201cowl\u201d is one of the key symbols of Illuminati domination and is even found in the layout of the streets of Washington D.C.)\u000a\u000aAs fans celebrate he Lady Gaga demonic performance, they are awash in \u201cblood\u201d red lighting, providing the camera a scene that\u2019s framed to show masses of Hell\u2019s minions (with the horned owl symbols in plain view) worshiping the Gaga goddess, the puppet of Satan as she flies through the air with witch-like powers:\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, Gaga stands atop a tower depicting the kind of \u201cevil architecture\u201d typically associated with dark forces such as the Dark Lord Sauron in the Lord of the Rings. Notice the clear depiction of Hell with the fiery red pyrotechnics and smoke, all while \u201cSatan\u2019s puppet\u201d dances atop a tower of evil while the bloodwashed masses cheer in celebration:\u000a\u000aHere\u2019s a wider shot of the \u201cstage of Hell\u201d into which Lady Gaga descends, clearly depicting a \u201cdescent into Hell\u201d where she performs and is worshiped by the blind, obedient masses:\u000a\u000aHere\u2019s Lady Gaga on the keyboard during halftime, being obediently worshiped by minions whose light hues are controlled by \u201ccentral command.\u201d The message is that they are nothing but \u201chuman drones\u201d to follow the bidding of their master, Lady Gaga:\u000a\u000aLady Gaga\u2019s blood-red stage with dancers dressed in white \u201cpsych ward\u201d outfits, while it\u2019s all sponsored by the PEPSI logo (Pepsi used aborted fetal cells in its soda flavoring research, see the link here).\u000a\u000aHere\u2019s a top-down view that was broadcast for less than one second, making it almost subliminal. Can someone decipher the symbols and meaning of this obviously engineered composition?\u000a\u000aHere\u2019s Gaga singing in \u201cHell\u201d with fireballs unleashed behind her as a \u201csea of obedient human drones\u201d follows orders to worship her as a true goddess of the underworld:\u000a\u000aThe dancers are not only dressed like escaped psych ward patients\u2026 this black dancer appears like a hooded KKK member as multiple dancers flip their white hoods over their heads during a song routine\u2026 complete with pointy hats and everything, as their master Lady Gaga is elevated to a higher position on the platform behind the hooded black dancers:\u000a\u000aWhy Satan is now right out in the open\u000a\u000aThese Satanic rituals are being shoved in our faces on live television because Satanic forces across the planet are, for the first time in a very long time, finally being exposed for what they truly are.

The goal is to achieve such a deep poisoning of the human psyche that mindless mobs of obedient human slaves will literally bow down before Satan and worship his agenda as it is rolled out through CNN, Hollywood movies, pop culture music and extremely dangerous multi-dimensional scientific experiments (CERN, large-scale quantum computing, etc).\u000a\u000aSatanic puppet masters like George Soros are desperately pumping funds into front groups that specialize in disinformation and deception, hoping to push America into a bloody civil war, producing a wave of human pain and suffering on which the demonic forces feed.

This is serious stuff&#8230; it&#8217;s just that 99.9% of humanity isn&#8217;t ready to cognitively grasp what I&#8217;m about to present here, so until people are more ready to face the reality of demonic evil in our world, I&#8217;m going to label all this a weekend joke.

The NFL is a joke anyway, right?</p>\u000a<p>The average Superbowl viewer is so totally clueless about reality that they have no idea what they&#8217;re even watching. Over the last several years, the NFL has slowly given way to the agenda of truly evil globalists, pushing quack science fraud (breast cancer &#8220;awareness&#8221; propaganda), anti-American hatred (Colin Kaepernick&#8217;s nauseating antics), cultural subversion agendas and vulgar halftime shows that frequently invoke Satanic imagery in ritualistic fashion (see the multitude of photos and videos below for proof).</p><p class="SBAArticle"></p><p>But those assaults on the human psyche are nothing compared to the &#8220;big agenda&#8221; of using the Superbowl halftime platform. I realize this may be hard for people to grasp if they aren&#8217;t informed about the deeper layers of wretched evil that have infested our world &#8212; the pizza shop pedophile stories barely scratch the surface &#8212; but the real purpose of the Superbowl halftime show is to <strong>ritualistically celebrate the power of Satan right in the open</strong>, declaring his dominion over the Earth by glorifying his imagery, words and worship on national television.</p>\u000a<h2><strong>Superbowl halftime shows are saturated with symbols of demonic rituals and Satan worship<br>\u000a</strong></h2>\u000a<p>If you&#8217;re not aware that this has been happening throughout Superbowl halftime shows in years past, you are wildly uninformed about the depth and brashness of the Satanic symbolism shoved right in your face during every Superbowl &#8220;indoctrination&#8221; ritual.

VDuring the eight-year span between 1955 and 1963, upwards of 98 million Americans were injected with polio vaccines that contained Simian Virus 40 (SV40). This virus, obtained from monkeys in the 1960s, has received considerable attention because it\u2019s linked to human cancers, including childhood leukemia, lung cancer, bone cancer and Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma.\u000a\u000aThis atrocity of modern science was well documented by the CDC\u2019s own fact sheet entitled: Cancer, Simian Virus 40 (SV40), and Polio Vaccine. In the document, the CDC revealed, \u201cMore than 98 million Americans received one or more doses of polio vaccine from 1955 to 1963 when a proportion of vaccine was contaminated with SV40.\u201d However, that fact sheet can no longer be found on the CDC\u2019s website. The original CDC archive no longer exists. The Google web cache of this document no longer exists, either.\u000a\u000aThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has committed \u201crevisionist history,\u201d while trying to cover up important historical facts.

Of course, there's only one tear-away portion even though most vaccine come in vials that contain 10 doses.

As printed in the VARIVAX insert:"Post-marketing experience suggests that transmission of vaccine virus may occur rarely between healthy individuals who develop a varicella-like rash and healthy susceptible contacts."This is an admission that the chickenpox vaccine can infect a person with chickenpox who can then spread it to someone else:Many vaccines are made with monosodium glutamate, the excitotoxin taste-enhancing chemical that destroys brain cells. It's also common to find vaccines formulated with mercury and aluminum.For example, this Varivax insert openly states the vaccine is manufactured with:Here's a warning not to take aspirin after being vaccinated, along with yet another warning that taking the vaccine can cause you to spread chickenpox to someone else.It states, in plain black and white: "It is rare, but possible, that once you have the vaccine, you could spread the chickenpox virus to others."And this portion of the vaccine insert admits the chickenpox vaccine can give you shingles:Additional side effects are disclosed here, and they include:... and so on.Finally, here's another listing of the ingredients in the vaccine:As you can see from the insert photos shown above, vaccines say all sorts of fascinating things on their legally required insert sheets that the media won't dare tell you.In fact, vaccine pushersbecause they want to keep you in the dark about the side effects and toxic ingredients used in vaccines.They also want you to be completely unaware that. Many measles outbreaks, it turns out, occur largely among children who were vaccinated against measles.These are the truths about vaccines they don't want you to know. Rather than have the public be informed, they prefer to slap you in the face with twisted claims of "SCIENCE!" combined with the condemnation, intimidation and censorship of anyone who actually tries to point out what the vaccine insert says in black and white. Yes,, even though what you are reading is documented by the vaccine manufacturer itself.Truly, the vaccine industry today is so corrupt and dangerous that it goes to great lengths to make sure no one reads the information on the insert. Just like the biotech industry, the vaccine industry goes to great lengths to make sure consumers have no idea what they are being injected with or swallowing.So if you're thinking about getting your child vaccinated against measles because of the Disneyland scare, I encourage you toand go visit a pharmacy or doctor and. If you read it and you're perfectly happy with all the ingredients, side effects and risks associated with that vaccine, then make whatever choice you want, knowing that you've at least conducted some due diligence rather than just blindly injecting your child with toxic chemicals the same way all the obedient sheeple do.Personally, I think injecting children with MSG, formaldehyde, mercury and aluminum is nothing more than. And it turns out many millions of people in America agree with that assessment. In fact, until the vaccine industry cleans up its act and removes the toxic ingredients from its vaccines, vaccine "compliance" will never be very high among the informed.</p></div>

It\u2019s not uncommon for George Soros-affiliated groups to attend events like this and foolishly support his atrocious agenda in a harmful manner.

V(Natural News) A new look at world temperature data claimed by the NOAA \u2014 the chief proponent of \u201cclimate change\u201d theory \u2014 discovers that global warming temperature data points are fabricated for large regions across the globe.\u000a\u000aThe NOAA simply fabricates temperature data wherever it wants, creating the false impression that global warming is backed by \u201ccredible science.\u201d In reality, climate change is the greatest scientific fraud ever committed in human history. But because it\u2019s a religion in the mind of climate change cultists, they don\u2019t feel they need real data! Since they already \u201cknow\u201d climate change is real, they simply make up whatever data they need to fulfill their apocalyptic climate doomsday beliefs driven by quack science.\u000a\u000aFollow more news on FAKE SCIENCE at FakeScience.news.\u000a\u000aVia Real Climate Science:\u000a\u000aNOAA shows the Earth red hot in December, with record heat in central Africa.\u000a\u000aNOAA Reported\u000a\u000aThe map above is fake.

They simply made up the record temperatures.\u000a\u000aNOAA Thermometer Data\u000a\u000aSatellites show that NOAA\u2019s\u201d record hot regions in Africa were actually close to normal.\u000a\u000aRSS / MSU Data Images / Monthly\u000a\u000aGavin Schmidt at NASA claims the imaginary NOAA data has been replicated by many other institutions.\u000a\u000aNOAA: Trump team may emphasize climate science uncertainty \u2014 Friday, February 3, 2017 \u2014 www.eenews.net\u000a\u000aHowever, when Gavin is confronted about his obviously bogus temperature graphs, he defends by saying \u201cit is not my data, I get it from NOAA.\u201d In fact, all of the supposedly independent agencies get the lion\u2019s share of their data from NOAA.\u000a\u000aNASA and NOAA are engaged in the biggest fraud in science history, and this needs to end now that criminals are no longer in control of our government.

VThousands of identity thieves have made away with hundreds of millions of dollars in stolen earnings from the Social Security program, a new internal government investigation has revealed. And roughly $30 million of this fiat loot was obtained by criminals committing identity theft using the social security numbers (SSNs) of people who are already deceased.\u000a\u000aAccording to the Social Security Administration\u2019s (SSA) inspector general, more than $200 million in questionable earnings were identified as having been disbursed between the tax years of 2009 and 2014. Most of this money was obtained by SSN theft, primarily amongst folks 85 years of age and older.\u000a\u000aAn audit recently released by the agency shows that many of the thefts were committed by individuals looking to work in the United States legally \u2014 in other words, they appear to be criminal aliens. And perhaps not surprisingly, many of those whose identities were stolen rank among the wealthier upper echelons of society.\u000a\u000a\u201cAlthough SSA had controls in place to prevent and detect SSN misuse, we found individuals were using elderly individuals\u2019 identities for work purposes,\u201d the SSA\u2019s audit explains. \u201cOur review of a sample of 126 elderly individuals showed that 37 of their identities had been used to earn about $4.6 million during Tax Years (TY) 2009 to 2014.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhile the SSA says it is aware of only eight instances in which the SSNs of elderly folks were being directly used to earn wages, it was discovered that the SSNs of 817 deceased individuals had also been stolen by others looking to work legally in the U.S., the illegal earnings obtained from these dead people collectively totaling nearly $30 million.\u000a\u000a\u201cOverall, SSNs belonging to 1,074 persons over the age of 85 were used for $145 million in earnings between 2009 and 2014,\u201d Free Beacon explains. \u201cRoughly $57 million in earnings were recorded to 7,949 SSNs that belonged to dead individuals.\u201d\u000a\u000aActors, producers top list of most stolen from in social security fraud schemes\u000a\u000aWhere a bulk of these thefts came from was the entertainment industry, experts say. Many of the ill-gotten gains obtained by identity thieves came from royalty payments that would have been made to dead actors or producers, had they still been alive. In 33 cases, the stolen identities were from deceased individuals that would have been over 100 years old, and whose collective wages would have topped $7.3 million.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe elderly are among the most vulnerable in our society and prime targets for identity thieves,\u201d the SSA inspector general said about the findings. \u201cTherefore, it is important to ensure that precautions are taken to properly safeguard their personally identifiable information and protect them against potential Social Security number misuse.\u201d\u000a\u000aOn the flip side, the SSA every year mistakenly lists 6,000 people who are still alive as deceased in its master death file.

VBills have been introduced in the New York legislature that would limit the warrant-less use of surveillance drones. This legislation would help thwart the federal surveillance state, and establish much needed privacy protections at the state level. The bill was introduced by a bipartisan coalition of six representatives on Jan 9, and the companion bill was introduced on Jan 6.\u000a\u000aUnder the new legislation, drone surveillance would require a warrant for most applications. The bills do, however, offer some exceptions to warrant requirements. Permissible exceptions include patrolling the nation\u2019s borders to enforce immigration law, or as a counter measures to a high risk terror situation. Any evidence that is gathered illegally from drones would be inadmissible in a court of law.\u000a\u000aAs reported by the Tenth Amendmend Center, the bill states, \u201cNo law enforcement agency or a state, county or municipal agency shall use a drone or other unmanned aircraft to gather, store or collect evidence of any type, including audio or video recordings, or both, or other information pertaining to criminal conduct or conduct in violation of a statute or regulation except to the extent specifically authorized in a valid search warrant; provided, however, that the use of a drone by a law enforcement agency or a state, county or municipal agency is not prohibited when exigent circumstances exist.\u201d (RELATED: Learn more about drones at DroneWars.news)\u000a\u000aThe proposed law would only apply to the state, but throws a wrench in the works of some federal programs. Much of the funding for state and local drones comes from the federal government, and is in violation of the constitution. Therefore, federal agencies use fusion centers and an information sharing federal program to tap into information collected by state and local law enforcement agencies.\u000a\u000aThe ISE serves as a channel for sharing information obtained without a warrant. According to their website, they provide necessary information for national security enhancements to analysts, operators and investigators, all of whom need to collaborate and share information among themselves, the private sector and with foreign allies.\u000a\u000aThe government funds and encourages a drone network at state and local levels in the U.S. It therefore has access to a huge data pool on Americans without having had to expend its resources to collect that information. When restrictions on drone use are placed at the state and local levels, it restricts the amount of data available for the feds to access. This represents a victory for privacy, and a setback to the surveillance state. Before the legislation can move forward through the process, however, it will still have to pass through the respective committees for a majority vote.\u000a\u000aNew Hampshire released a similar bill\u000a\u000aProposed legislation in New Hampshire would end any state cooperation with the feds in spying without a warrant. Passing it will help hinder unconstitutional federal surveillance. The state and its political subdivisions would be prohibited from collecting data to assist a federal agency unless there was a warrant issued. The information sharing environment program currently facilitates the feds in tracking the movements and data of Americans, including phone calls, emails, web browser history and text messages \u2013 all without warrants, probable cause or the knowledge of affected citizens.

V(Natural News) A coalition of farmer and environmental groups has filed a lawsuit against the Environmental Protection Agency for failing to follow the law in approving Monsanto\u2019s newest herbicide, \u201cXtendiMax\u201d (active ingredient dicamba), for spraying directly on a new generation of genetically modified crops.\u000a\u000aThe plaintiffs in the suit are the Center for Biological Diversity, Center for Food Safety, National Family Farm Coalition and the Pesticide Action Network.\u000a\u000a\u201cFederal regulators have abandoned the interests of farmers, the environment, and public health,\u201d plaintiffs\u2019 counsel George Kimbrell said. \u201cWe won\u2019t allow our food to be dragged backward into a pesticide-soaked nightmare \u2013 not without a hell of a fight.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe approval is expected to lead to a tenfold increase in the amount of dicamba sprayed. This will not even offset the use of other chemicals; the new herbicide is approved for use on soybean and cotton crops genetically engineered to resist both dicamba and glyphosate (Roundup). Thus, spraying of Roundup will continue.\u000a\u000aDicamba has been linked with cancer and birth defects, while glyphosate is classified by the World Health Organization as a \u201cprobable carcinogen.\u201d Both have been shown to have devastating effects on wildlife and to contaminate water supplies.\u000a\u000aDicamba in particular is known to drift large distances from the fields where it is sprayed.

Thus, spraying of Roundup will continue.</p>\u000a<p>Dicamba has been linked with cancer and birth defects, while glyphosate is classified by the World Health Organization as a &#8220;probable carcinogen.&#8221; Both have been shown to have devastating effects on wildlife and to contaminate water supplies.</p>\u000a<p>Dicamba in particular is known to drift large distances from the fields where it is sprayed.

VThe number of exorcisms has been rising sharply in Italy, with some 500,000 Italians requesting an exorcism each year and not nearly enough exorcists to meet the rising demand, according to recent reports.\u000a\u000aArticle by Thomas D. Williams\u000a\u000aThe archdiocese of Milan in northern Italy has doubled the number of its exorcists, while an exorcism hotline has been launched in Rome, but those in the field claim it isn\u2019t nearly enough.\u000a\u000aRome\u2019s most famous exorcist, Father Gabriele Amorth (pictured), died last month and his successor, Father Vincenzo Taraborelli, says that he cannot keep up with the daily requests for liberation from demonic influence. \u201cPadre Vincenzo,\u201d as he is known, handles some 30 \u201cclients\u201d a day, and is calling on the Church to appoint more priests as exorcists to share in the mission of satanic deliverance.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere are only nine of us left and many more are needed,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need other priests like me to meet the needs of so many families.\u201d\u000a\u000aLast month, an Italian documentary on exorcism called \u201cLiberami\u201d won the award for \u201cbest film\u201d in the Venice Horizons category at this year\u2019s Venice Film Festival, drawing still more attention to this rapidly growing industry.\u000a\u000aIn her film, director Federica Di Giacomo\u2019s explores the exorcism efforts of Father Cataldo, a veteran exorcist in Sicily who is sought out in increasing numbers by Catholics who suspect they may be tormented or possessed by the devil.\u000a\u000aJust south of Rome, in the diocese of Frosinone, exorcist Father Ildebrando Di Fulvio receives a constant stream of people asking for help \u201ccountering the strength of the devil\u201d in the Cistercian abbey where he works.\u000a\u000aThough quick to admit that many people who believe they are possessed are actually suffering from chronic depression or other mental illnesses, Di Fulvio says that the devil\u2019s main advantage is \u201cconvincing people he doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d\u000a\u000aDi Fulvio says that there are a number of external signs that can help distinguish between someone under the influence of Satan from someone who is mentally ill. Such signs include \u201ca deformed facial expression; a cavernous voice; spitting out food or metallic objects they never ingested; speaking in archaic languages they don\u2019t know consciously like Hebrew, ancient Greek, Latin, and Aramaic; an unnatural physical strength they don\u2019t normally possess; and violent reactions to deliverance prayers and holy water.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe priest also noted that often people become possessed after participating in séances or Satanic masses, or after joining Satanic sects and cults.\u000a\u000aFather Aldo Buonaiuto, an exorcist in the northeastern Catholic diocese of Fabriano-Matelica, shares Di Fulvio\u2019s concerns. According to the priest, some 10 million Italians have consulted wizards, witches, fortune tellers, and astrologers at least once in their lives.\u000a\u000a\u201cMost of them are charlatans who dupe desperate customers, but among them are some Satanists,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aAs \u201ctools of the trade,\u201d every exorcist carries a crucifix and holy water, and there are established deliverance prayers and rites used for the exorcism itself.\u000a\u000a\u201cExorcisms aren\u2019t for the faint of heart and patients must go through a spiritual journey first,\u201d says Buonaiuto. \u201cThe first step is speaking with family members and psychiatrists to identify whether it\u2019s a medical issue or not.\u201d\u000a\u000aRead more at: Breitbart.com

VA three-part anthology containing peer-reviewed climate science published in 2016 has revealed that the so-called scientific consensus on climate change \u2014 that mankind is directly responsible for causing it \u2014 is little more than declaratory bias and anti-science nonsense. Some 500 academic papers included in this new eyeopening volume show that natural variables, and not human activity, comprise the bulk of what affects the climate conditions of our planet, once again proving the man-made climate change theory to be a lie.\u000a\u000aAdding to more than 500 other papers published between 2014-2015 that came to similar conclusions, this latest body of research calls into question decades of research that has blamed modern mankind\u2019s use of fossil fuels for warming earth temperatures and rising sea levels. As it turns out, real science shows that air and water conditions are constantly in flux, and that these variances are more a product of natural earth cycles like sun activity and oceanic oscillations than people driving cars and eating meat.\u000a\u000aAnthropogenic CO2 emissions, as they\u2019re often called, include things like air pollution from factories and cars, and these factors most often bear the brunt of climate criticism. But this judgment is entirely without merit, as research countering the man-made climate change hypothesis \u2014 of which there is plenty \u2014 paints a much different picture as to why climate conditions aren\u2019t the same as they were 20 years ago.\u000a\u000a\u201c[T]hese scientific papers strongly suggest that natural factors \u2026 have both in the past and present exerted a significant or dominant influence on weather and climate changes, which means an anthropogenic signal may be much more difficult to detect in the context of such large natural variability,\u201d writes Kenneth Richard for No Tricks Zone.\u000a\u000a\u201cPapers questioning (and undermining) the \u2018consensus\u2019 view on paleoclimate (Medieval) warmth, ocean acidification, glacier melt and advance, sea level rise, extreme weather events, past climate forcing mechanisms, climate sensitivity to CO2, etc., are included in this collection.\u201d\u000a\u000aUnited Nations largely responsible for perpetuating fake science in support of man-made climate change\u000a\u000aThe volume is broken down into three sections, which can be accessed here, here, and here. See for yourself how special interests, specifically within the United Nations (U.N.), have been pushing climate propaganda for decades, and steering the science to suit an agenda that blames humans for causing these changes, even when a cohort of research shows that the earth itself is to blame for these changes.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019m not surprised by the large number of empirical evidence that rejects the CO2 dangerous global warming alarmism,\u201d says Dr. Willie Soon, an astrophysicist from Harvard University who believes the U.N.\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (I.P.C.C.) has veered off course into the realm of fake science. \u201cThis sort of literature review ought to put the sort of biased, if not anti-science, reports by the U.N. I.P.P.C. to shame.\u201d\u000a\u000aBased on everything that\u2019s currently coming out about climate change, it appears as though there really isn\u2019t much of a consensus at all when it comes to this widely discussed issue. Not only is the earth not necessarily on a crash course to destruction, but the policies that have been enacted in response to this erroneous position could be working towards this end rather than against it.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is high time for the wider public to not only bear witness to the unbalance and corruption of our science institutions, but also to demand answers on why there has been such a disregard for truth and fact,\u201d says Dr. Soon, with the backing of others like Canadian climatologist Dr. Tim Ball who believes that global warming became a \u201ccharade\u201d many years ago.\u000a\u000aSources:\u000a\u000aNoTricksZone.com\u000a\u000aNoTricksZone.com

Not only is the earth <i>not</i> necessarily on a crash course to destruction, but the policies that have been enacted in response to this erroneous position could be working towards this end rather than against it.</p>\u000a<p>&#8220;It is high time for the wider public to not only bear witness to the unbalance and corruption of our science institutions, but also to demand answers on why there has been such a disregard for truth and fact,&#8221; says Dr. Soon, with the backing of others like Canadian climatologist Dr. Tim Ball who believes that global warming became a &#8220;charade&#8221; many years ago.</p>\u000a<p><b>Sources:</b></p>\u000a<p><a href="http://notrickszone.com/2017/01/03/1000-skeptical-peer-reviewed-climate-papers-should-put-un-ipcc-to-shame-says-harvard-astrophysicist/#sthash.svAHFmCc.izi3jkDB.dpbs" target="_blank">NoTricksZone.com</a></p>\u000a<p><a href="http://notrickszone.com/2017/01/02/crumbling-consensus-500-scientific-papers-published-in-2016-support-a-skeptical-position-on-climate-alarm/#sthash.f1EChPZm.HW29rPWl.dpbs" target="_blank">NoTricksZone.com</a></p>\u000a\u000a \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a<p id="mc_embed_signup">\u000a \u000a</p>\u000a<p></p>\u000a<p></p>\u000a<p></p>\u000a</div>

VHave you ever wondered how ginger helps fight diseases. Research shows that it has bioactive compounds that fight leukemia, ovarian, prostate, colon cancer and more. Ginger has also been proven to prevent blood clotting, reduce arthritis symptoms and lower risk of heart disease.\u000a\u000aThe most bioactive compound in ginger is the gingerols. It is responsible for most of the medicinal, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties in ginger. Other bioactive compounds include shogaol, gingerenone A, paradol, dehydro, hexahydrocurcumin, methoxy, and tetrahydrocurcumin.\u000a\u000aIf you use fresh ginger you will get more compounds like vitamin B6, vitamin C, calcium, magnesium, potassium, phosphorous, and Sulphur.\u000a\u000aStudies: Ginger vs Cancer\u000a\u000aHere are a few studies that show the potency of ginger in fighting cancer.\u000a\u000aStudy #1\u000a\u000aAccording to this study, ginger can prevent different types of cancer including prostrate, brain, liver, oral, gastric, ovarian, colon, breast, skin, renal, and pancreatic cancer.\u000a\u000aThese benefits were mainly attributed to three bioactive compounds \u2013 gingerol, paradol, and shogaol. These bioactive compounds have antimutagenic, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties.\u000a\u000aStudy #2\u000a\u000aIn this study, researchers concluded that the bioactive compounds in ginger can treat ovarian cancer. They found that the ginger root extract had the ability to prevent growth of ovarian cancer cells and kill them.\u000a\u000aThere is good news \u2013 researchers say that cancer cells aren\u2019t resistant to ginger treatment as they are to chemotherapy. And another advantage is that ginger doesn\u2019t have side effects like chemo.\u000a\u000aStudy #3\u000a\u000aGingerol, shogaol, and conjugate metabolites can lower risk of colon, prostate and breast cancer, according to this study.\u000a\u000aIn fact, the study found that there are lower cases of cancer in regions where cancer is commonly used to cook.\u000a\u000aStudy #4\u000a\u000aResearchers found that ginger can lower risk of prostate cancer and other types of cancer. You can kill tumors by consuming 567 mg of ginger extract or 100g of fresh ginger every day.\u000a\u000aNow, don\u2019t wait until you\u2019re sick to use ginger, start using it today to lower risk of cancer and fight many other diseases.\u000a\u000aIf you struggle with belly fat or want to lose weight without starving yourself, watch the 2-MINUTE trick that shrinks belly fat.

VAs the angry Left continues to protest President Donald J. Trump\u2019s lawful executive order banning entry of some refugees from terrorism-infested countries, there are certain realities these people are ignorant of or are willfully ignoring.\u000a\u000aFirst and foremost, it needs to be said that had Hillary Clinton won the election, there is little doubt that she would have continued to pursue the very same immigration and refugee policies as President Barack Obama, and in fact, she said as much during and after the campaign.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf we claim we are for family, then we have to pull together and resolve the outstanding issues around our broken immigration system,\u201d Clinton said in May 2015, according to her campaign website. \u201cThe American people support comprehensive immigration reform not just because it\u2019s the right thing to do\u2013and it is\u2013but because they know it strengthens families, strengthens our economy, and strengthens our country. \u2026 We can\u2019t wait any longer for a path to full and equal citizenship.\u201d (RELATED: Find out what Hillary Clinton is doing these days at Clinton.news)\u000a\u000aNote to Hillary: If our immigration system is broken, it\u2019s because our immigration laws are not being fully enforced.\u000a\u000aBut she knows that. Indeed, this kind of language is standard fare for every Leftist; it\u2019s code for wall-free, wide open borders, allowing entrance for whomever wants to come and for whatever reason they want to do so.\u000a\u000aWere that the case, we would cease to be a country. No nation is a nation if it has no borders.\u000a\u000aBeyond that reality, open borders invite terrorism (as well as a host of social and cultural problems). Just take an honest look at what is going on in Europe. Since the \u201crefugee crisis\u201d that some have said was exacerbated, if not started, by the Obama administration\u2019s support for the \u201cArab Spring,\u201d hundreds of thousands of people from Syria, Yemen, Iraq, Libya and other countries that are destroying themselves (with Western help) have streamed into Europe, bringing with them their Islamic faith and cultural aversion to Western liberalism.\u000a\u000aWith them have also come terrorist operatives who, on behalf of the Islamic State, have killed hundreds of people while disrupting civil society in a half-dozen European nations, the largest of which is Germany.\u000a\u000aAnd yet, the Left-leaning leaders of these countries continue to invite more of these refugees in, doubling down on bad policy to the point where their own people are beginning to reject them.\u000a\u000aClinton would have adopted these same self-destructive policies, as her carefully-worded code language proves. And the discredited establishment media would have cheered every single one as progressive, forward-thinking, values we can be proud of, and what America really stands for.\u000a\u000aBut her policies would have been every bit as dangerous and self-destructive as those in Europe have proven to be \u2013 and already proved to be in the U.S. during the Obama administration. Clinton\u2019s policies would have led to even more attacks like those in San Bernardino, Calif., at the Boston Marathon, and in Orlando, Fla.\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s more, terrorists would be gaming our system under Clinton, just as they\u2019ve done in Europe. As noted by M. G. Oprea, writing for The Federalist, \u201cPolitically correct platitudes provided cover for ISIS agents to infiltrate Europe inside the refugee bands that swarmed borders.\u201d (RELATED: What immigration actions has President Trump taken lately to protect our country? Find out at InvasionUSA.news)\u000a\u000aOprea noted:\u000a\u000a\u201cIn Germany last week, the vice president of Bavaria\u2019s intelligence-gathering agency, Manfred Hauser, announced ISIS \u2018hit squads\u2019 had entered Europe with the flood of migrants that came across the borders over the last year and a half. According to Hauser, there are hundreds of reports that these kinds of terrorist cells have infiltrated European countries, and \u2018irrefutable evidence that there is an IS command structure in place\u2019 that will \u2018likely\u2019 launch a coordinated attack on Germany.\u201d\u000a\u000aGermany\u2019s entrance policy for migrants \u2013 especially for those from Syria \u2013 are some of the most liberal in all of Europe. But as any clever enemy will do, ISIS has taken advantage of it to infiltrate the Christian West so that it can begin slaughtering people its leaders and supporters view as the enemy.\u000a\u000aHad Clinton been in the Oval Office this past week instead of Trump, refugee-related executive orders coming out of the administration would have looked more like those of politically correct Germany and France than a nation with responsible adults at the helm. And while the media would have cheered any Left-wing immigration/refugee policy signed by a President Hillary Clinton, those policies would have done nothing to enhance our security. They would have put more Americans at risk.\u000a\u000aJ.D.

V(Natural News) Climate change alarmists have come up with a new doom-and-gloom scenario: global warming equals physical violence.\u000a\u000aThis heat-stress theory was put forth by two Iowa State researchers, a post-doctoral fellow and a liberal arts professor, who start off their essay by claiming that \u201cEnvironmental scientists from multiple disciplines have overwhelmingly acknowledged human-driven climate change as fact.\u201d\u000a\u000aConsider the source may be operative here, because as Health Ranger Mike Adams recently pointed out, the oft-repeated claim that 97% of scientists agree that man-made climate change is settled science \u2014 as if science is ever settled \u2014 is a bunch of hot air.\u000a\u000aGrandstanding globalist Al Gore has even come out with a new movie that tries to reverse engineer his fake climate apocalypse predictions from the first film. (RELATED: Read more about fake science predictions at fakesciencenews.com.)\u000a\u000aBut wait, there\u2019s more. As alluded to above, according to a lengthy essay published on the Association for Physiological Science website, \u201cA growing body of evidence shows that rapid global warming can (and is) increasing violent behavior.\u201d\u000a\u000aReferencing numerous studies, they argue that people tend to get hot under the collar, and physically aggressive when the temperature rises to an uncomfortable level.

V(Natural News) In a wildly viral article from TheEconomicCollapseBlog.com, Michael Snyder reveals that prepping has collapsed among Trump supporters since the day of the election. \u201c[I]nterest in prepping is probably the lowest that it has ever been in the history of the modern prepper movement. A couple of weeks ago, I wrote an article about how it was like \u2018a nuclear bomb went off in the prepping community\u2019, and nothing has changed since that time,\u201d Snyder wrote.\u000a\u000aLiberals and leftists, meanwhile, are suddenly stocking up like mad on food, guns and ammo. In an article titled, \u201cNow it\u2019s the liberals who are arming up,\u201d McClatchyDC.com reports, \u201cGun shop owner Michael Cargill told NBC News gun classes at his Austin, Texas store are selling out. He\u2019s noticed an increase in LGBTQ, African-American, Hispanic and Muslim customers. Store owners told NBC they\u2019ve seen up to four times as many minority customers than is typical.\u201d\u000a\u000aLiberals, it seems, are scared about the possible rise in \u201chate crimes\u201d under a Trump presidency. What they don\u2019t realize, of course, is that nearly all the hate crimes are hate hoaxes committed by leftists. But that doesn\u2019t stop them from buying guns, which is probably a smart thing to do no matter what the fear behind it.\u000a\u000aPreppers are being lulled into complacency by the final blow off of a wildly overvalued stock market\u000a\u000aMy warning for all preppers \u2014 no matter what your political affiliation \u2014 is that if you\u2019ve been lulled into a sense of complacency by the rising stock market and the Trump election victory, you could be making the biggest mistake of your life. Here\u2019s why:\u000a\u000aThe Federal Reserve has already set the debt collapse apocalypse into motion by raising interest rates. The dominoes that will fall have already begun to tumble. The Fed promises two more interest rate hikes (at least) next year, giving the absurd excuse that the \u201cObama economy is overheating\u201d from all its economic abundance and must therefore be slowed down using interest rate hikes.\u000a\u000aThis is all being done to create a false narrative that Obama is handing Trump a \u201crobust economy.\u201d Next, rising interest rates are coupled with a halting of quantitative easing and the acceleration of debt instrument failures in Europe. The result is that at some moment in President Trump\u2019s first term, the global debt collapse is unleashed, unraveling the decades of debt creation and mindless bank deregulation we all witnessed under Clinton, Bush and Obama.\u000a\u000aWhen that nightmare lands in Trump\u2019s lap, the most likely outcome in the streets of America will be mass riots and social chaos at a level America has never before witnessed. Remember: This is all being set into motion to blame Trump and discredit the Republican party. I\u2019ve released a mini-documentary explaining all this. You can read the full transcript at this link. Watch the video here:\u000a\u000aWhat the mass riots are going to really look like\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s difficult to give you the full picture of what these riots will really look like, but I can start by explaining that the food stamps will almost certainly stop working for an extended period of time. You can probably imagine what that will mean in America\u2019s inner cities. No free food from the government? Burn it down! (That\u2019s what the food stamp recipients will be shouting as the also chant, \u201cKill the pigs!\u201d)\u000a\u000aBut let me back up for a second and share something that will help you understand the \u201cfinancial freeze\u201d that will immediately follow the global debt collapse. There\u2019s an outstanding book by Jim Rickards called The Road to Ruin: The Global Elites\u2019 Secret Plan for the Next Financial Crisis. I strongly recommend you read or listen to this book (it\u2019s available on Audible.com, too).\u000a\u000aAs Rickards explains, the government\u2019s solution to the next big banking crisis will be to \u201cfreeze\u201d institutions and transactions, much like the \u201cIce-Nine\u201d molecule in Kurt Vonnegut\u2019s Cat\u2019s Cradle fiction novel. As described in the book, Ice-Nine was a special kind of water molecule that was frozen solid at room temperature (its melting point was higher than room temperature). More importantly, Ice-Nine would convert all other water molecules it touched into Ice-Nine molecules. Thus, it could spread like a molecular pandemic, freezing ponds, streams, rivers and eventually, entire oceans.\u000a\u000aThe coming debt collapse will function much like Ice-Nine, Rickards explains. Because of the global interconnectedness of central banks, investment funds and retail banks, once the next large collapse strikes a single institution, it will spread to all the other connected institutions, \u201cfreezing\u201d their transactions and assets in the same way that Ice-Nine would freeze rivers and lakes.\u000a\u000aThe newly frozen institutions will, in turn, spread the \u201cfinancial freeze\u201d to all the other institutions to which it is connected. Because no bank operates in isolation these days \u2014 everything is connected \u2014 the Ice-Nine financial freeze will quickly spread through the entire financial system, locking up the western world\u2019s financial infrastructure on which everything in our society depends (including food stamps).\u000a\u000aWhen ATMs stop working and food stamps collapse, the ignorant, unprepared, left-wing masses go berserk\u000a\u000aThis means no one will be able to get cash out of their ATMs. Food stamps won\u2019t work. Credit card transactions will be halted at retail. Businesses won\u2019t be able to write checks, wire money or deposit funds. Essentially, just imagine the worst case scenario in the world of banking and finance\u2026 that\u2019s what\u2019s coming.\u000a\u000aThe effects on the streets shouldn\u2019t be difficult to visualize. As the following chart from Visual Capitalist shows, nearly 52% of Millennials have less than $1,000 in savings. This number is even worse among females, where nearly 57% have less than $1,000 in savings.\u000a\u000aAcross the nation, the numbers are similarly alarming. A 2013 article from CNN.com reported that \u201cRoughly three-quarters of Americans are living paycheck-to-paycheck, with little to no emergency savings, according to a survey released by Bankrate.com Monday.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe article explains that 22% of Americans don\u2019t even have enough cash to cover a $100 emergency expense, and 46% can\u2019t cover an $800 expense.\u000a\u000aConsider how this plays out when the Ice-Nine freeze kicks in across America\u2019s financial institutions. Bluntly stated, approximately half the population will face starvation in just one week due to an inability to purchase food.\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s when nearly every major U.S. city begins to burn. President Trump will have no choice but to declare martial law and roll out troops on the streets. The starving masses \u2014 mostly leftists who failed to prepare \u2014 will loot, steal, rob and murder anyone in sight if it gives them something to eat.\u000a\u000aIt is during this time that you will thank yourself for having some storable food on hand (like my certified organic survival food buckets). You\u2019ll be thrilled that you picked up that extra Glock or POF-USA rifle. You\u2019ll wish you had spent twice as much money on ammo, gold and silver (instead of the Starbucks, porn and lotto tickets you blew it on).\u000a\u000aDon\u2019t forget about the mindless zombies who demand your stuff, citing \u201cequality\u201d\u000a\u000aAs you ponder all this, don\u2019t forget about the mindless liberal \u201czombies\u201d who will wander out of the cities in a desperate effort to loot the suburbs and countryside for food and medicine supplies. I know, it\u2019s insulting to call them \u201czombies.\u201d But it\u2019s actually not a bad description for a humanoid organism of low intelligence that\u2019s incapable of planning. Those are the ones will will be the greatest threat to you and your safety (their total lack of preparedness turns into YOUR emergency when they show up at your door demanding you \u201cshare\u201d your stuff).\u000a\u000aThe communist-leaning philosophy of the political left is also extremely dangerous during times of social chaos. Because they\u2019ve been taught that \u201cinequality\u201d is an evil thing, they truly believe that your stuff belongs in their hands so that everybody is \u201cequal.\u201d Of course, they didn\u2019t spend equal time or money to prepare, did they? So what they\u2019re really doing is justifying their theft by calling it \u201cequality.\u201d (And that\u2019s communism in a nutshell, come to think of it.)\u000a\u000aIf you live in a rural area, you may want to double check the range, in yards, to your front gate, and match it to your DOPE charts. If you don\u2019t know why that\u2019s important, you might not be qualified to live in the country during a zombie apocalypse. Make sure you have a PVS-14 at the ready, since the zombies come out at night, as Michael Jackson showed us in Thriller.\u000a\u000aI\u2019m also a proponent of micro-caching, meaning hiding your stuff in small containers that are distributed in different places around your home or yard. Don\u2019t have all your stash in one place. It\u2019s not a bad idea to have a spare handgun, ammo and some gold or silver coins buried in an air-tight, water-tight container that you can recover when needed. The MTM SAC Survivor Ammo Can is a good choice. You can pick these up for around $20.\u000a\u000aFind a great review of survival caching at SurvivalCache.com, which covers humidity, corrosion control and other topics.\u000a\u000aWhere to find more information on surviving the coming financial apocalypse (and zombie wave)\u000a\u000aI\u2019ve just launched a new website that hasn\u2019t even been announced yet. It\u2019s called CENSORED.news\u000a\u000aThere, we bring you all the top headlines (in near real-time) from the largest and most censored alternative news sites on the \u2018net. Monitor that site for breaking news from all your favorite news sources.\u000a\u000aI\u2019m also the creator of GoodGopher.com, the independent media search engine that allows you to find information that\u2019s banned by Google, Facebook and Twitter. Search GoodGopher.com for anything, including details on survival caching, gun selection, precious metals and more.\u000a\u000aOf course, also keep checking Natural News and News Target for more news on preparedness and survival. Throughout 2017, I\u2019ll be focusing on bringing you a lot of hands on how-to content for self-reliance and survival.

You&#8217;ll be thrilled that you picked up that extra Glock or <a href="pof-usa.com" target="_blank">POF-USA rifle</a>. You&#8217;ll wish you had spent twice as much money on ammo, gold and silver (instead of the Starbucks, porn and lotto tickets you blew it on).</p>\u000a<h2><strong>Don&#8217;t forget about the mindless zombies who demand your stuff, citing &#8220;equality&#8221;</strong></h2>\u000a<p>As you ponder all this, don&#8217;t forget about the mindless liberal &#8220;zombies&#8221; who will wander out of the cities in a desperate effort to loot the suburbs and countryside for food and medicine supplies. I know, it&#8217;s insulting to call them &#8220;zombies.&#8221; But it&#8217;s actually not a bad description for a humanoid organism of low intelligence that&#8217;s incapable of planning. Those are the ones will will be the greatest threat to you and your safety (their total lack of preparedness turns into YOUR emergency when they show up at your door demanding you &#8220;share&#8221; your stuff).</p>\u000a<p>The communist-leaning philosophy of the political left is also extremely dangerous during times of social chaos. Because they&#8217;ve been taught that &#8220;inequality&#8221; is an evil thing, they truly believe that your stuff belongs in their hands so that everybody is &#8220;equal.&#8221; Of course, <strong>they didn&#8217;t spend equal time or money to prepare</strong>, did they? So what they&#8217;re really doing is justifying their theft by calling it &#8220;equality.&#8221; (And that&#8217;s communism in a nutshell, come to think of it.)</p>\u000a<p>If you live in a rural area, you may want to double check the range, in yards, to your front gate, and match it to your DOPE charts. If you don&#8217;t know why that&#8217;s important, you might not be qualified to live in the country during a zombie apocalypse. Make sure you have a PVS-14 at the ready, since the zombies come out at night, as Michael Jackson showed us in Thriller.</p>\u000a<p>I&#8217;m also a proponent of micro-caching, meaning hiding your stuff in small containers that are distributed in different places around your home or yard. Don&#8217;t have all your stash in one place. It&#8217;s not a bad idea to have a spare handgun, ammo and some gold or silver coins buried in an air-tight, water-tight container that you can recover when needed. The MTM SAC Survivor Ammo Can is a good choice. You can pick these up for around $20.</p>\u000a<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://www.naturalnews.com/gallery/articles/Survivor-Ammo-Can.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="360"></p>\u000a<p>Find a great review of survival caching at <a href="http://survivalcache.com/survival-gear-review-monovault/" target="_blank">SurvivalCache.com</a>, which covers humidity, corrosion control and other topics.</p>\u000a<h2><strong>Where to find more information on surviving the coming financial apocalypse (and zombie wave)</strong></h2>\u000a<p>I&#8217;ve just launched a new website that hasn&#8217;t even been announced yet.

V(NaturalNews) In the U.S. these days, supporting GOP presidential nominee Donald J. Trump will earn you an assault from Left-wing cowards and bullies who support Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton . But in China, being a political dissident and opposing the ruling Communist government could earn you a trip to a hospital operating room.Where you'll have your organs removed for waiting "transplant tourists."As reported by the Epoch Times , Chinese officials began persecuting the 100 million practitioners of Falun Gong in July 1999, and have continued to do so ever since. To the Chinese communists, there is no such thing as a religious deity or belief, because communists insist that their form of government should be the only thing requiring loyalty and faithfulness.Not long ago this kind of treatment of Chinese "dissidents" would draw loud rebukes from the U.S. government, the United Nations and various human rights organizations around the world, as well as major media coverage. But since the Chinese manufacturing economy has become such an integral part of the economies of most of the world's advanced countries, outrage has been muted.The lack of outrage and subsequent media coverage and pressure by governments has essentially given the Chinese communists a green light to treat Falun Gong \u2013 and anyone else deemed a political dissident \u2013 in any barbaric way they choose.Hence, the creation of a cottage industry of sorts \u2013 Transplant Tourism. As thenoted, this is essentially " murder on demand " for an organ that is purchased ahead of time by someone who then travels to China for a transplant operation. It is a huge source of revenue both for the Chinese military and for private hospitals around the country, according to Nobel Prize nominees and investigators David Matas, an international human rights attorney, and David Kilgour, a former Canadian foreign secretary for Asia-Pacific.Matas and Kilgour published their first investigative report in 2006 , and evidence about forced harvesting of organs in China from prisoners of conscience has only mounted in the years since. The investigators found that the overwhelming majority of the pool of victims did not come from prisoners sentenced to death but rather from prisoners of conscience, primarily followers of Falun Gong \u2013 the largest group in China's prisons.In their 2006 report, Matas described the systematic harvesting of organs from Falun Gong adherents by the Chinese Communist Party as "a new form of evil we have yet to see on this planet."One of the founding board members of Doctors Against Forced Organ Harvesting (DAFOH), Dr. Dana Churchill, spoke at rallies in Los Angeles and Santa Monica Beach earlier this month. She said that to this point the world had never witnessed a "more horrific and barbaric crime as the Chinese Communist Party has committed against Falun Gong."She added that it wasn't just Falun Gong adherents who were being victimized, however. Others include Christians, the Uyghurs and Tibetans, all of whom have also had their organs harvested "while they are alive, unwilling, and between 20 and 40 years old, the prime of their life," Churchill \u2013 a naturopathic doctor from Pasadena, Calif., said.noted that recently released findings on the number of Chinese prisoners who have been murdered go way beyond original estimates collected from various investigators and organizations.Churchill said: "With Falun Gong, approximately 65,000 have been murdered, and that is according to DAFOH, our organization."At a Washington, D.C., rally on July 17, 2015, following nine years of investigation, the World Organization to Investigate the Persecution of Falun Gong announced that it had "concluded that since July 20, 1999, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), lead by its former head Jiang Zemin, has utilized China's entire state apparatus to harvest organs from living Falun Gong practitioners," as a way to "physically destroy" the group as a whole."This is genocide and a crime against humanity," the organization concluded.

VDespite popular belief, keeping children in a sanitary bubble may not be what is best for them. Science continues to suggest that getting a little dirty is actually better for kids.\u000a\u000aIn an interview with The Current\u2018s Anna Maria Tremonti, Canadian microbiologist, and co-author of \u201cLet Them Eat Dirt: Saving Your Child From An Oversanitized World,\u201d B. Brett Finlay, says,\u201dWe\u2019re finding these microbes help our bodies train the immune system.\u201d\u000a\u000aFinlay says that many of the ailments that plague Western society actually have microbial links. Obesity, anxiety, stress, depression, autism, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel diseases \u2014 even things like allergies and asthma \u2014 can all be linked back to microbes, according to Finlay.\u000a\u000aHand sanitizer, while used with good intentions, is likely doing more harm than good, says Finlay. While keeping your children clean (preferably with natural soap) is important, there is such a thing as \u201ctoo clean.\u201d It kills off bacteria before your child\u2019s immune system can learn how to respond accordingly \u2014 and contact with microbes is necessary for a fledgling immune system to learn to be effective.\u000a\u000aThere is a wealth of scientific research to support Finlay\u2019s viewpoint. For example, a study published in 2015 revealed that children raised in homes with dogs were less likely to develop asthma. Another study of Swedish children revealed that kids who grew up on farms also had a decreased risk of developing asthma.\u000a\u000aNew York Daily News reported that Dr. Clifford W. Bassett, medical director, Allergy and Asthma Care of NY and a professor at NYU and Cornell Medical College commented, \u201cIt appears farm environments and rural environments and exposure to farm animals may lead to a more healthy or robust immune system and in some studies appears to be setting the stage to reducing asthma.\u201d Basset was very familiar with earlier studies that had unveiled similar findings.\u000a\u000aMany other studies have indicated that early exposure to microbes helps to prevent a wide range of conditions. A study published in 2012 by the journal Science found that germ-free early years could be setting the stage for a host of different diseases. They compared normal mice to mice that were raised in germ-free conditions. The germ-free mice exhibited substantially higher levels of invariant natural killer T cells (iNKT) \u2014 a special type of white blood cell \u2014 in their lungs and intestines.\u000a\u000aThe proteins released by iNKT cells are known to cause inflammation and attract more inflammatory white blood cells. Many of the autoimmune conditions described above feature inflammation as a primary player in the onset of disease.\u000a\u000aAdditionally, iNKT cells are considered to be an \u201cactive ingredient\u201d in asthma, a condition that affects the lungs, and ulcerative colitis, which is an inflammatory bowel disease.\u000a\u000aDennis Lee Kasper, study researcher, a senior physician at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston, told LiveScience that one of the most significant differences between the two groups of mice was the increase in susceptibility to autoimmune disease. \u201cThe germ-free mice were much more susceptible to the diseases than the germ-exposed mice,\u201d Kasper commented.\u000a\u000aWhile this research was conducted on animals, other research continues to show that the same is likely true for human children. Finlay says that the scientific research showing a link between decreased microbial diversity and the rise of disease in the Western world continues to mount. He notes that early childhood exposure seems to be particularly important.\u000a\u000a\u201cFor the poor germophobe mothers out there,\u201d says Finlay. \u201cI feel sorry for them because they\u2019re trying to do the very best.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWe\u2019ve been told keeping your kids clean is the best thing you can do for them.

V11 Fruits and Veggies High in Vitamin C

VOranges, also called sweet oranges, are among the world\u2019s most popular fruits and popular for their vitamin C content. Juicy and sweet, oranges make the perfect snack and add a special tang to many recipes.\u000a\u000aStudies have shown that consuming vitamin C can\u2019t actually prevent colds. However, I am sure some of you have experienced yourself that the consumption vitamin C-rich fruits when you have colds or flu can actually reduce the duration and severity.\u000a\u000aRenowned for its concentration of vitamin C, a medium orange 131 g contains 69.7 mg vitamin C, equivalents to 116% Daily Values (DV), which is actually less compared to that of many other common fruits and veggies.\u000a\u000aCompare: 100 g contains 53.2 mg vitamin C and 88% DV\u000a\u000aRidiculous Measurements\u000a\u000aThe followings are 12 fruits and veggies containing vitamin C.

V(Natural News) Lower back pain is the leading cause of disability worldwide, according to the American Chiropractic Association. At any given time, about 31 million Americans are dealing with this debilitating condition. It is one of the most common reasons people miss work and is the second most common reason for doctors\u2019 visits. In fact, as much as 80 percent of the population will experience back pain at some point.\u000a\u000aAnd those of us who have suffered with back pain know just how incapacitating it can be. Back pain is perceived to be 20 times worse than pain anywhere else in the body because of how close these muscles are to the spinal cord.\u000a\u000aScientists had already confirmed that paracetamol (commonly known as Tylenol in the U.S.), the most widely used painkiller in the world, is totally ineffective for back pain.\u000a\u000aWith this in mind, a group of Australian researchers from the University of Sydney and St Vincent\u2019s Hospital & University of New South Wales decided to investigate whether another class of painkillers, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), were effective at treating back pain.\u000a\u000aFor their study, which was published in the journal, Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases, scientists analyzed 35 peer-reviewed trials, including data from 6,065 patients, to investigate the use of NSAIDs such as ibuprofen for the treatment of back pain.\u000a\u000aTheir findings were that though NSAIDs did have some effect on spinal pain, the difference between the NSAID and placebo groups was so negligible as to be considered not clinically important. In laymen\u2019s terms, they found that NSAIDs were little more effective than placebos for the treatment of back pain.\u000a\u000a\u201cThese drugs are effective for other conditions but for people with back pain, we believe there is a bigger role for other treatments,\u201d said lead author, Associate Professor Manuela Ferreira of the George Institute for Global Health, affiliated with the University of Sydney.\u000a\u000aThe researchers\u2019 suggested (an unsurprising) solution.\u000a\u000a\u201cAt present, there are no simple analgesics that provide clinically important effects for spinal pain over placebo. There is an urgent need to develop new drug therapies for this condition.\u201d [Emphasis added]\u000a\u000aOf course, more drugs.\u000a\u000aIn fact, there are already many natural, non-invasive therapies that have been proven to be effective at treating back pain.\u000a\u000aChiropractic care is one such solution. According to the American Chiropractic Association, the journal, Annals of Internal Medicine, \u201cpointed to chiropractic care as one of the major nonpharmacologic therapies considered effective for acute and chronic low back pain.\u201d\u000a\u000aThere are several other natural remedies to try, including acupressure, yoga and stretching.\u000a\u000aAnd there is a very effective natural supplement that has proven effective for many people. As reported by Natural News, independent studies found that the African herb, Devil\u2019s Claw, eased back pain at least as well as prescription medication, but without any side effects. The recommended dose for those who want to try this natural solution is 204 grams a day.\u000a\u000aAnother very surprising solution to back pain is to stay well hydrated. Scientists have found that dehydrated muscles are prone to cramping, leading to pain. Of course, drinking fluoridated, heavy metal infested water is not helpful, so be sure to drink water that has been carefully filtered.\u000a\u000aThere are actually loads of things that each one of us can do to prevent getting back pain in the first place. Maintain a healthy weight, exercise regularly (focusing on gentle stretching exercises), practice mindfulness to reduce stress, and be sure to stay well hydrated, and you\u2019ll be able to stay well away from Big Pharma\u2019s harmful (and useless) chemical medicine.\u000a\u000aAfter all, prevention is always better than cure.\u000a\u000aSources:\u000a\u000aTheGuardian.com\u000a\u000aACAToday.org\u000a\u000aARD.BMJ.com\u000a\u000aNaturalNews.com

At any given time, about 31 million Americans are dealing with this debilitating condition. It is one of the most common reasons people miss work and is the second most common reason for doctors&#8217; visits. In fact, as much as 80 percent of the population will experience back pain at some point.</p>\u000a<p>And those of us who have suffered with back pain know just how incapacitating it can be. Back pain is perceived to be 20 times worse than pain anywhere else in the body because of how close these muscles are to the spinal cord.</p>\u000a<p>Scientists had already confirmed that <a href="http://science.naturalnews.com/paracetemol.html">paracetamol (commonly known as Tylenol in the U.S.)</a>, the most widely used painkiller in the world, is totally ineffective for back pain.</p>\u000a<p>With this in mind, a group of Australian researchers from the University of Sydney and St Vincent&#8217;s Hospital &amp; University of New South Wales decided to investigate whether another class of painkillers, <a href="http://science.naturalnews.com/NSAIDs.html">non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)</a>, were effective at treating back pain.</p>\u000a<p>For their study, which was published in the journal, Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases, scientists analyzed 35 peer-reviewed trials, including data from 6,065 patients, to investigate the use of NSAIDs such as ibuprofen for the treatment of back pain.</p>\u000a<p>Their findings were that though NSAIDs did have some effect on spinal pain, the difference between the NSAID and placebo groups was so negligible as to be considered not clinically important. In laymen&#8217;s terms, they found that NSAIDs were little more effective than placebos for the treatment of back pain.</p>\u000a<p>&#8220;These drugs are effective for other conditions but for people with back pain, we believe there is a bigger role for other treatments,&#8221; said lead author, Associate Professor Manuela Ferreira of the George Institute for Global&#160;Health, affiliated with the University of Sydney.</p>\u000a<p>The researchers&#8217; suggested (an unsurprising) solution.</p>\u000a<p>&#8220;At present, there are no simple analgesics that provide clinically important effects for spinal pain over placebo. There is an urgent <strong>need to develop new drug therapies</strong> for this condition.&#8221; [Emphasis added]</p>\u000a<p>Of course, more drugs.</p>\u000a<p>In fact, there are already many <a href="http://www.naturalcures.news/">natural, non-invasive therapies</a> that have been proven to be effective at treating back pain.</p>\u000a<p>Chiropractic care is one such solution. According to the American Chiropractic Association, the journal, Annals of Internal Medicine, &#8220;pointed to chiropractic care as one of the major nonpharmacologic therapies considered effective for acute and chronic low back pain.&#8221;</p>\u000a<p>There are several other natural remedies to try, including acupressure, yoga and stretching.</p>\u000a<p>And there is a very effective natural supplement that has proven effective for many people. As reported by Natural News, independent studies found that the African herb, Devil&#8217;s Claw, eased back pain at least as well as prescription medication, but without any side effects. The recommended dose for those who want to try this natural solution is 204 grams a day.</p>\u000a<p>Another very surprising solution to back pain is to stay well hydrated. Scientists have found that dehydrated muscles are prone to cramping, leading to pain. Of course, drinking fluoridated, <a href="http://www.metals.news" target="_blank">heavy metal infested water</a> is not helpful, so be sure to <a href="http://bigberkey.naturalnews.com/bigberkey.html">drink water that has been carefully filtered</a>.</p>\u000a<p>There are actually loads of things&#160;that each one of us can do to prevent getting back pain in the first place. Maintain a healthy weight, exercise regularly (focusing on gentle stretching exercises), practice mindfulness to reduce stress, and be sure to stay well hydrated, and you&#8217;ll be able to stay well away from <a href="http://bigpharmanews.com">Big Pharma&#8217;s harmful (and useless) chemical medicine</a>.</p>\u000a<p>After all, prevention is&#160;always better than cure.</p>\u000a<p><strong>Sources:</strong></p>\u000a<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/feb/03/back-pain-medications-have-little-benefit-and-may-cause-harm-research">TheGuardian.com</a></p>\u000a<p><a href="https://www.acatoday.org/Patients/Health-Wellness-Information/Back-Pain-Facts-and-Statistics">ACAToday.org</a></p>\u000a<p><a href="http://ard.bmj.com/content/early/2017/01/20/annrheumdis-2016-210597.short?g=w_ard_ahead_tab">ARD.BMJ.com</a></p>\u000a<p><a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/028087_natural_cures_back_pain.html">NaturalNews.com</a></p>\u000a \u000a</div>

VIn recent weeks a \u201cnew patriotism\u201d has swept the country of Mexico, or at least, that\u2019s what the discredited \u2018mainstream media\u2019 would have you believe.\u000a\u000aAgence France Press ran a story a few days ago that is long on claims and short on facts. For instance, the story claimed that Mexicans:\u000a\u000a\u2014 Are angry about President Donald Trump\u2019s insistence that their country pay for the border wall;\u000a\u000a\u2014 Are set in mass numbers to boycott American products and brands (the story mentioned three: Starbucks, McDonald\u2019s, and Coca-Cola);\u000a\u000a\u2014 Are using pro-Mexico hashtags all over social media.\u000a\u000aThe story appears to be the latest attempt by the media to make Mexico appear as though it is being victimized by the Trump administration and has to \u201cfight back.\u201d But the reality is just the opposite, as usual. (RELATED: How is the media failing you today? Discover the truth at MediaFactWatch.com)\u000a\u000aAs reported by SHTFPlan.com, if anyone should be worried, it\u2019s Americans, making it even more necessary than ever to have that border wall Trump has set in motion.\u000a\u000aMuch of Mexico is ungovernable, and that is due in large part to the heavy presence and influence of the country\u2019s large and dangerous drug cartels. Many of them wield more firepower than many Mexican army units and they have more cash at their disposal than entire states. One former Mexican foreign affairs secretary, Jorge Castañeda Gutman, has all but threatened they would be unleashed on the American public if Trump doesn\u2019t back down from his pledges.\u000a\u000aIn an interview with CNN\u2019s Fareed Zakaria, an accused serial plagiarist, Gutman hinted that his country\u2019s so-called drug enforcement assistance to the U.S. might not only be pulled, but the cartels might actually be turned on our country.\u000a\u000a\u201cMexico has a lot of negotiating chips in this matter, Fareed, but it also has measures we could take in other areas,\u201d he said, as quoted by STHFPlan.com. \u201cFor example, the drugs that come through Mexico from South America, or the drugs that are produced here in Mexico all go to the United States. This is not our problem. We have been cooperating with the United States for many years on these issues because they\u2019ve asked us to and because we have a friendly, trustful relationship. If that relationship disappears, the reasons for cooperation also disappear.\u201d\u000a\u000aDid Gutman just threaten to export Mexico\u2019s drug violence to the United States, as it has been exporting its poverty and criminals for decades? Some would certainly view it as a threat, and they\u2019d be right.\u000a\u000aThere\u2019s little question that the Mexican government has long been infested with officials and mid-level careerists who are owned and operated by the cartels. Graft and corruption is rampant in Mexico. The Los Angeles Times reported in 2008 that then-Mexican President Felipe Calderon said his government was making a bit of progress in battling the cartels but \u201cthat graft remained a threat to the nation\u2019s efforts against crime.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe paper noted further:\u000a\u000aMexico has long been rife with corruption, which ranges from the small bribes that motorists pay traffic officers to the suitcases of cash that drug traffickers have delivered to law enforcement authorities. Ordinary Mexicans routinely pay bribes to get telephone service, loans, and even parking spaces.\u000a\u000aLittle changed in the ensuing years, except maybe that cartel violence only got worse. As Breitbart reported in December 2015, that year was \u201cfilled with drug violence, controversy, and crime.\u201d In fact, rather than see decreases, \u201cthe country has begun to see escalating violence in places previously untouched.\u201d (RELATED: Keep up with all of the threats to American society at Collapse.news)\u000a\u000aDrug cartels regularly gun down scores of rivals, kill local officials who refuse to be bribed, behead victims, and fill mass graves. And now, at least one former Mexican official wants to see the same thing happen in American cities.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s not hard to understand why Mexican officials are petrified that the Trump administration is going to make good on its promises to build a wall (on Mexico\u2019s peso), and crack down on border security: Once those two things happen, it will be much more difficult for the country to export it\u2019s social ills.\u000a\u000aBut given Gutman\u2019s not-so-veiled warning, it\u2019s just further justification for Trump to keep his campaign promise to keep Americans safe.\u000a\u000aJ.D.

VA priest in Italy has caused uproar after announcing there would be no Christmas nativity scene at the local cemetery this year because it could offend Muslims and atheists.\u000a\u000aArticle by Nick Hallett\u000a\u000aFr Sante Braggiè said there would be no crib in the cemetery in the northern city of Cremona because it may anger people of others faiths or none whose relatives are buried there.\u000a\u000a\u201cA small corner of the cemetery is reserved for Muslim graves,\u201d Fr Braggiè said. \u201cA crib positioned within sight of them could be seen as a lack of respect for followers of other faiths, hurt the sensibilities of Muslims, as well as Indians and even atheists.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe also cited a lack of council workers to set up the crib as another reason for abandoning the tradition.\u000a\u000aCorriere della Serra reports that Fr Braggiè\u2019s predecessor as local priest, Fr Oreste Mori, strongly criticised the decision, saying: \u201cSeriously?

VJanette Murray-Wakelin is a breast cancer survivor who credits a raw food diet, meditation, physical activity, and following her intuition for her ability heal. In the early 2000s, she was diagnosed with Stage 3 breast cancer and told that she had just six months to live, without any guarantees. However, within those same six months, she was given a clean bill of health and also went on to participate in hundreds of marathons in only one year.(1,2) That\u2019s right, in just one year.\u000a\u000aShe explains that she was offered chemotherapy, but that it \u201cdidn\u2019t make sense\u201d to her.(1)\u000a\u000a\u201cI was already compromised, so why would I compromise myself further so I\u2019d get another six months of being sick?\u201d(1) Rather than embrace what she calls a \u201cvery fear-driven\u201d mindset that many doctors create in such a situation, she shunned their chemo and radiation recommendations in favor of alternative methods that she felt were significantly wiser and healthier choices. \u201cMost people go with what their doctor says because they don\u2019t realize that they can take responsibility and control themselves,\u201d Murray-Wakelin says.(1)\u000a\u000aThe Decision to Walk Away from Traditional Cancer Treatments\u000a\u000aSo, without hesitation, she walked away from traditional cancer treatments and started asking herself what she could put in her body to make a difference.

However, she believes that accidental exposure to high-chemical substances that got on her skin and being in an area where she was exposed to toxic levels of pollution led to her diagnosis.(1)\u000a\u000aUpon receiving news of her breast cancer, she immediately immersed herself in research and read up on others who chose to forego traditional cancer treatments.

VStand up paddle boarding is a more relaxed version of surfing. Some even call it stand up paddle surfing as opposed to its more common name. If you\u2019re unfamiliar with what stand up paddle boarding is; its an activity in which the rider stands on a floating board, similar to a surf board, but balances while propelling his or her self with a paddle. Its becoming increasing popular among beach and lake goers, as its fun, exciting or relaxing depending on the environment, and gives you an excellent workout. Lets take a look at the health benefits that stand up paddle boarding can give you.\u000a\u000aLow Impact Exercise\u000a\u000aSince stand up paddle boarding requires that you be standing and balancing for the majority of your session, it is an excellent low impact workout. Its not very likely that you will do any damage to the tendons or ligaments of your joints while engaged in the activity, since you are often gliding over the soft water without abrupt changes in elevation that would result in stress of impact. Even when the waves get a little choppy, the board still tends to glide and softly bounce up and down with little raw impact.\u000a\u000aStress Relief\u000a\u000aIt is well known that being around bodies of water can be soothing to the mind, but being in the water can be soothing to the body as well. The sounds of gliding through the water coupled with paddle boarding\u2019s unique sense of walking upon the water can be an excellent source of stress relief. You may also find yourself maintaining a rhythm as your paddle strokes the water\u2019s surface, which adds to the therapeutic benefits of paddle boarding.\u000a\u000aWork Out The Entire Body\u000a\u000aWhile paddle boarding, you will find yourself using nearly ever muscle in your body. Your legs will be firm and use different muscles as the board sways from side to side, your back, arms, and shoulders will be used in a gentle, almost rowing motion as you propel yourself through the water. Your abdominal muscles and core are constantly working to keep you balanced and stabilized. This combination of constant, low impact, whole body exercise will result in increased full body strength very quickly without risking damage to the ligaments.\u000a\u000aIncrease Your Endurance\u000a\u000aAfter learning to paddle board, the act of stroking the water with your paddle and constantly having to adjust your balance will keep you in motion. It may be even more-so for a newbie to paddle boarding, as you may find yourself falling off and having to go for a brief swim and climb back atop the board, adding even more dynamics to the exercise that paddle boarding provides. This means that the more you paddle board, the more endurance you will build. It doesn\u2019t take long to notice the benefits of this increased full body endurance.\u000a\u000aBeing Outside Can Be Good For You\u000a\u000aCoupled with the calming nature of the water, you will also be acquiring more sunlight. As long as you wear sunblock to help keep your skin from burning, you will wind up with numerous health benefits from the increased sunlight. It can have a positive effect on your mental health, as well as increasing your body\u2019s natural vitamin D production.\u000a\u000aHeart Healthy\u000a\u000aSince an activity such as paddle boarding keep you in constant motion, it will serve to increase your cardiovascular circulation. This increased circulation, coupled with the overall increased fitness of the body, can lead to a reduced chance of becoming the victim of a heart attack or stroke.\u000a\u000aSources:

Currently, about 44 million people worldwide have this affliction, which is obviously reaching epidemic proportions as the population ages. Dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease have overtaken heart disease as the leading cause of death globally. More than five million cases of Alzheimer\u2019s have been diagnosed in the U.S. [RELATED: Read more about brain health at Brain.news.]\u000a\u000aAn America Lung Association 2016 \u201cState of the Air\u201d report indicates that Los Angles and several other California cities are among the worst for PM2.5 air pollution which is generated by car exhaust and other sources.\u000a\u000aAs an aside, big cities are longtime Democrat strongholds when election day rolls around. Could voting behavior be influenced by the air residents breathe? As the saying goes in another context, your mileage may vary.\u000a\u000aMicroscopic PM2.5 particles are the offending pollutants identified in the USC study as risk factors for cognitive decline.\u000a\u000aThe USC study published in the Translational Psychiatry journal tracked the health of about 3,600 women in their 60s and 70s across the country who were dementia-free at the time they enrolled in the Women\u2019s Heath Initiative Memory Study. The authors maintain that in the long run, environmental improvements, particularly in the air that people breathe, can reduce the risk of Alzheimer\u2019 disease. [RELATED: Read more about environmental issues at Enviro.news.]\u000a\u000a\u201cScientists and engineers found that older women who live in places with fine particulate matter exceeding the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s standard are 81 percent more at risk for global cognitive decline and 92 percent more likely to develop dementia, including Alzheimer\u2019s. If their findings hold up in the general population, air pollution could be responsible for about 21 percent of dementia cases, according to the study,\u201d a USC press release explained.\u000a\u000aThe particles go from the nose to the brain, causing an inflammatory response that increases the risk of Alzheimer\u2019s and other brain disorders, study co-author Caleb Finch of the USC Leonard Davis School of Gerontology remarked.\u000a\u000aThe scientists also suggest that women carrying the APOE4 gene were more at risk for pollution-related dementia.\u000a\u000aMice experiments were also included in the findings about dirty air and brain damage.

V10 Common Habits That Seriously Damage Your Kidneys

VOur kidneys are super important for our health. They filter our blood, produce hormones, absorb minerals, produce urine, eliminate toxins, and neutralize acids. So as one of the most important organs in your body, your kidneys deserve some love.\u000a\u000aDamage or steady decline of your kidneys can often go unnoticed for years as your kidneys can still do their job with as little as 20% of their capacity. Therefore kidney diseases are often referred to as \u201cThe Silent Diseases\u201d. That\u2019s why it is so important to take care of them before it is too late.\u000a\u000aHere\u2019s a list of 10 common habits that put a lot of pressure on your kidneys and can cause serious damage over time.\u000a\u000a1. Not Drinking Enough Water\u000a\u000aYour kidney\u2019s most important function is to filter blood and eliminate toxins and waste materials. When you don\u2019t drink enough plain water during the day toxins and waste material start to accumulate and can cause severe damage to your body.\u000a\u000a2. Too Much Salt In Your Diet\u000a\u000aYour body needs sodium or salt to work properly. Most people however consume too much salt which may raise blood pressure and put a lot of stress on the kidneys. As a good rule of thumb, no more than 5 grams of salt should be eaten on a daily basis.\u000a\u000a3. Frequently Delaying The Call Of Nature\u000a\u000aMany of us ignore the urge to go because they are too busy or want to avoid public bathrooms. Retaining urine on a regular basis increases urine pressure and can lead to kidney failure, kidney stones, and incontinence. So listen to your body when nature calls.\u000a\u000a4. Kick The Sugar Habit\u000a\u000aScientific studies show that people who consume 2 or more sugary drinks a day are more likely to have protein in their urine. Having protein in your urine is an early sign your kidneys are not doing their job as they should.\u000a\u000a5. Vitamin And Mineral Deficiencies\u000a\u000aEating a clean, whole food diet full of fresh vegetables and fruits is important for your overall health and a good kidney function. Many deficiencies can increase the risk of kidney stones or kidney failure. Vitamin B6 and magnesium, for instance, are super important to reduce the risk of kidney stones.\u000a\u000aAn estimated 70 to 80 percent of Americans isn\u2019t getting enough magnesium, so there may be a good chance that you are one of them. Click here to learn more about magnesium deficiencies.\u000a\u000a6. Too Much Animal Protein\u000a\u000aOver consumption of protein, especially red meat, increases the metabolic load on your kidneys. So more protein in your diet means your kidneys have to work harder and this can lead to kidney damage or dysfunction over time.\u000a\u000a7. Sleep Deprivation\u000a\u000aWe have all heard how important it is to get a good night\u2019s rest. Chronic sleep deprivation is linked to many diseases and kidney diseases are also on the list. During the night your body repairs damaged kidney tissue, so give your body the time to heal and repair itself.\u000a\u000a8. Coffee Habit\u000a\u000aJust as salt, caffeine can raise blood pressure and put extra stress on your kidneys. Over time excessive consumption of coffee can cause damage to your kidneys.\u000a\u000a9. Painkiller Abuse\u000a\u000aWay too many people take painkillers for their small aches and pains, while there are many all-natural, safe remedies available. Excessive use or painkiller abuse can lead to severe damage of liver and kidneys.\u000a\u000a10. Alcohol Consumption\u000a\u000aAlthough there is nothing wrong with enjoying a glass of wine or having a beer once in a while, most of us don\u2019t stop after just one drink. Alcohol is actually a legal toxin that puts a lot of stress on our kidneys and liver.\u000a\u000aTo stay healthy and avoid kidney issues it is important to eat lots of fresh, whole foods and if you keep the above information in mind and avoid these common habits as much as possible, your kidneys will not be under constant stress and your body will thank you for that.\u000a\u000aIf you want to reset your kidneys and heal your body from the inside out, click here to access a 10-day whole food fruit and veggie detox that won\u2019t leave you hungry or short in nutrients,\u000a\u000aDon\u2019t forget to download my FREE green smoothie eBook to sneak more kidney-friendly leafy greens and fruits into your diet or connect with me on Facebook or Google+ for more healthy tips, tricks, and recipes.

Most people however consume too much salt which may raise blood pressure and put a lot of stress on the kidneys. As a good rule of thumb, no more than 5 grams of salt should be eaten on a daily basis.</p>\u000a<h3>3.&#160;&#160;&#160; Frequently Delaying The Call Of Nature</h3>\u000a<p>Many of us ignore the urge to go because they are too busy or want to avoid public bathrooms. Retaining urine on a regular basis increases urine pressure and can lead to kidney failure, kidney stones, and incontinence. So listen to your body when nature calls.</p>\u000a<h3>4.&#160;&#160;&#160; Kick The Sugar Habit</h3>\u000a<p>Scientific studies show that people who consume 2 or more sugary drinks a day are more likely to have protein in their urine. Having protein in your urine is an early sign your kidneys are not doing their job as they should.</p>\u000a<h3>5.&#160;&#160;&#160; Vitamin And Mineral Deficiencies</h3>\u000a<p><a href="http://blogs.naturalnews.com/clean-eating-101-simple-rules-live-healthy-clean-lifestyle/">Eating a clean, whole food diet</a> full of fresh vegetables and fruits is important for your overall health and a good kidney function. Many deficiencies can increase the risk of kidney stones or kidney failure. Vitamin B6 and magnesium, for instance, are super important to reduce the risk of kidney stones.</p>\u000a<p>An estimated 70 to 80 percent of Americans isn&#8217;t getting enough magnesium, so there may be a good chance that you are one of them. <a href="http://www.body-in-balance.org/blog/nutrition/need-magnesium/">Click here to learn more about magnesium deficiencies</a>.</p>\u000a<h3>6.&#160;&#160;&#160; Too Much Animal Protein</h3>\u000a<p>Over consumption of protein, especially red meat, increases the metabolic load on your kidneys. So more protein in your diet means your kidneys have to work harder and this can lead to kidney damage or dysfunction over time.</p>\u000a<h3>7.&#160;&#160;&#160; Sleep Deprivation</h3>\u000a<p>We have all heard how important it is to get a good night&#8217;s rest. Chronic sleep deprivation is linked to many diseases and kidney diseases are also on the list. During the night your body repairs damaged kidney tissue, so give your body the time to heal and repair itself.</p>\u000a<h3>8.&#160;&#160;&#160; Coffee Habit</h3>\u000a<p>Just as salt, caffeine can raise blood pressure and put extra stress on your kidneys. Over time excessive consumption of coffee can cause damage to your kidneys.</p>\u000a<h3>9.&#160;&#160;&#160; Painkiller Abuse</h3>\u000a<p>Way too many people take painkillers for their small aches and pains, while there are many all-natural, safe remedies available. Excessive use or painkiller abuse can lead to severe damage of liver and kidneys.</p>\u000a<h3>10. &#160;Alcohol Consumption</h3>\u000a<p>Although there is nothing wrong with enjoying a glass of wine or having a beer once in a while, most of us don&#8217;t stop after just one drink. Alcohol is actually a legal toxin that puts a lot of stress on our kidneys and liver.</p>\u000a<p>To stay healthy and avoid kidney issues it is important to eat lots of fresh, whole foods and if you keep the above information in mind and avoid these common habits as much as possible, your kidneys will not be under constant stress and your body will thank you for that.</p>\u000a<p><strong><a href="http://www.body-in-balance.org/detox">If you want to reset your kidneys and heal your body from the inside out, click here to access a 10-day whole food fruit and veggie detox that won&#8217;t leave you hungry or short in nutrients,</a></strong></p>\u000a<h4><strong>Don&#8217;t forget to&#160;</strong><a href="http://www.body-in-balance.org/greensmoothie/"><strong>download my FREE green smoothie eBook</strong></a>&#160;<strong>to sneak more kidney-friendly leafy greens and fruits into your diet&#160;or connect with me on&#160;</strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/bodyinbalance.org?ref=hl"><strong>Facebook</strong></a><strong>&#160;or&#160;</strong><a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/110735384659166983609/+Body-in-balanceOrg/posts"><strong>Google+</strong></a><strong>&#160;for more healthy tips, tricks, and recipes.</strong></h4>\u000a                </div>

VThe importance of B12 in the human body is hard to overestimate.\u000a\u000aAnd while you hear things like how it\u2019s important for your nerves, DNA and red blood cells among many other things, what does a lack of it actually do in more \u201cevery day\u201d language?\u000a\u000aTo answer that, let\u2019s take a look at a case study of what can happen when your levels get too low.\u000a\u000aA real life example of what happens from low B12\u000a\u000aThe New England Journal of Medicine reported on the case of 62 year old man who, during the course of several weeks, starting having varied symptoms.\u000a\u000aHe experienced numbness, difficulty walking and intense joint pain. He had \u201cstinging\u201d sensations in his hands almost like pins poking him. His skin took on a yellowish color and shortness of breath would often occur.\u000a\u000aHe was checked out at Massachusetts General Hospital and they pinpointed the cause as a severe lack of B12 in his blood.\u000a\u000aI highly encourage you to get a blood test for B12 and to know what your own levels are.\u000a\u000aIf you can\u2019t do that anytime soon, here are 7 common warning signs that are linked to low levels of this vitamin.\u000a\u000aSigns that you may be B12 deficient\u000a\u000aMemory loss, impaired thinking and general cognitive difficulties.\u000a\u000aIf you have difficulty walking, tend to stagger, or have balance problems.\u000a\u000aVarious and \u201codd\u201d sensations throughout your body, numbness, or tingling that occurs in your hands, legs or feet\u000a\u000aYellowish or jaundiced skin.\u000a\u000aAnemia\u000a\u000aA swollen tongue or if it\u2019s inflamed.\u000a\u000aGeneral weakness and fatigue\u000a\u000aIf B12 levels drop to into the severely deficient range, it can lead to much worse conditions.\u000a\u000aDeep states of depression, hallucinations and paranoia are all associated with extremely low levels. Losing the ability to taste and smell has even been linked to low B12.\u000a\u000aAnd since it\u2019s such an important part of brain health, it can lead to greatly diminished brain functioning, beyond what is mentioned above.\u000a\u000aSo what leads to low B12?\u000a\u000aHere are some things to look out for, that can lead to or cause lower B12 levels.\u000a\u000aA vegetarian or vegan diet (since plants don\u2019t make B12, and you would need to supplement with B12 to keep your levels up).\u000a\u000aCertain medications like PPI\u2019s\u000a\u000aGut issues such as \u201cleaky gut\u201d or an inflamed gut.\u000a\u000aPernicious anemia\u000a\u000aLow stomach acid or taking drugs to suppress acid production in the stomach.\u000a\u000aOther things can include Metformin, a drug used for diabetes, people aged 60 and over and women who have had infertility issues in the past.\u000a\u000aWhat to do?\u000a\u000aEat a lot eggs, dairy, poultry and animal sources of protein, which are all good sources of this vitamin.\u000a\u000a(Quick note: you may hear things like fermented soy or spirulina and other sources have B12, but many of these plant-based foods have B12 analogs. These are called cobamides and they can block your intake of \u201creal\u201d B12 that your body needs).\u000a\u000aIf eating any of the above isn\u2019t an option for you for any reason, you\u2019ll want to supplement with B12.\u000a\u000aAnd a form of B12 called methylcobalamin is your best bet, since it is better absorbed within your body.\u000a\u000aOK, so what are optimal B12 levels to shoot for?\u000a\u000aIn the United States, you\u2019ll see lab reference ranges as low as 250 or 300 pg/mL (picograms per milliliter) listed as \u201cnormal\u201d when they are anything but.\u000a\u000aAs an example, Japan uses a lower limit of around 500 pg/mL and recommends treatment for anything below that number since B12 deficiency symptoms can start showing up at levels lower than 500.\u000a\u000aPersonally, I\u2019d like to see B12 levels in the 800 to 1200 pg/mL range for optimal health.\u000a\u000aPlease do get your levels tested though as soon as you can.\u000a\u000aAnd if you happen to find yourself with any of the warning signs described above or with levels of 400 or lower, you may want to boost your B12 and see what this powerful vitamin can do for you.\u000a\u000aYou\u2019ll discover a list of additional things you can immediately do to experience extraordinary health by going here.\u000a\u000aNow available: You can get the special report How to Heal Almost Anyone of Almost Anything using these 3 missing healing factors that works to reverse almost any condition.

V<div><p>The importance of B12 in the human body is hard to overestimate.</p>\u000a<p>And while you hear things like how it&#8217;s important for your nerves, DNA and red blood cells among many other things, what does a lack of it actually do in more &#8220;every day&#8221; language?</p>\u000a<p>To answer that, let&#8217;s take a look at a case study of what can happen when your levels get too low.</p>\u000a<p>&#160;</p>\u000a<p><strong>A real life example of what happens from low B12</strong></p>\u000a<p>&#160;</p>\u000a<p>The New England Journal of Medicine reported on the case of 62 year old man who, during the course of several weeks, starting having varied symptoms.</p>\u000a<p>He experienced numbness, difficulty walking and intense joint pain. He had &#8220;stinging&#8221; sensations in his hands almost like pins poking him. His skin took on a yellowish color and shortness of breath would often occur.</p>\u000a<p>He was checked out at Massachusetts General Hospital and they pinpointed the cause as a severe lack of B12 in his blood.</p>\u000a<p>I highly encourage you to get a blood test for B12 and to know what your own levels are.</p>\u000a<p>If you can&#8217;t do that anytime soon, here are 7 common warning signs that are linked to low levels of this vitamin.</p>\u000a<p>&#160;</p>\u000a<p><strong>Signs that you may be B12 deficient</strong></p>\u000a<p>&#160;</p>\u000a<ul>\u000a<li>Memory loss, impaired thinking and general cognitive difficulties.</li>\u000a</ul>\u000a<p>&#160;</p>\u000a<ul>\u000a<li>If you have difficulty walking, tend to stagger, or have balance problems.</li>\u000a</ul>\u000a<p>&#160;</p>\u000a<ul>\u000a<li>Various and &#8220;odd&#8221; sensations throughout your body, numbness, or tingling that occurs in your hands, legs or feet</li>\u000a</ul>\u000a<p>&#160;</p>\u000a<ul>\u000a<li>Yellowish or jaundiced skin.</li>\u000a</ul>\u000a<p>&#160;</p>\u000a<ul>\u000a<li>Anemia</li>\u000a</ul>\u000a<p>&#160;</p>\u000a<ul>\u000a<li>A swollen tongue or if it&#8217;s inflamed.</li>\u000a</ul>\u000a<p>&#160;</p>\u000a<ul>\u000a<li>General weakness and fatigue</li>\u000a</ul>\u000a<p>&#160;</p>\u000a<p>If B12 levels drop to into the severely deficient range, it can lead to much worse conditions.</p>\u000a<p>Deep states of depression, hallucinations and paranoia are all associated with extremely low levels. Losing the ability to taste and smell has even been linked to low B12.</p>\u000a<p>And since it&#8217;s such an important part of brain health, it can lead to greatly diminished brain functioning, beyond what is mentioned above.</p>\u000a<p>&#160;</p>\u000a<p><strong>So what leads to low B12?</strong></p>\u000a<p>&#160;</p>\u000a<p>Here are some things to look out for, that can lead to or cause lower B12 levels.</p>\u000a<p>A vegetarian or vegan diet (since plants don&#8217;t make B12, and you would need to supplement with B12 to keep your levels up).</p>\u000a<p>Certain medications like PPI&#8217;s</p>\u000a<p>Gut issues such as &#8220;leaky gut&#8221; or an inflamed gut.</p>\u000a<p>Pernicious anemia</p>\u000a<p>Low stomach acid or taking drugs to suppress acid production in the stomach.</p>\u000a<p>Other things can include Metformin, a drug used for diabetes, people aged 60 and over and women who have had infertility issues in the past.</p>\u000a<p>&#160;</p>\u000a<p><strong>What to do?</strong></p>\u000a<p>Eat a lot eggs, dairy, poultry and animal sources of protein, which are all good sources of this vitamin.</p>\u000a<p>(Quick note: you may hear things like fermented soy or spirulina and other sources have B12, but many of these plant-based foods have B12 analogs. These are called cobamides and they can block your intake of &#8220;real&#8221; B12 that your body needs).</p>\u000a<p>If eating any of the above isn&#8217;t an option for you for any reason, you&#8217;ll want to supplement with B12.</p>\u000a<p>And a form of B12 called methylcobalamin is your best bet, since it is better absorbed within your body.</p>\u000a<p>&#160;</p>\u000a<p><strong>OK, so what are optimal B12 levels to shoot for?</strong></p>\u000a<p>&#160;</p>\u000a<p>In the United States, you&#8217;ll see lab reference ranges as low as 250 or 300 pg/mL (picograms per milliliter) listed as &#8220;normal&#8221; when they are anything but.</p>\u000a<p>As an example, Japan uses a lower limit of around 500 pg/mL and recommends treatment for anything below that number since B12 deficiency symptoms can start showing up at levels lower than 500.</p>\u000a<p>Personally, I&#8217;d like to see B12 levels in the 800 to 1200 pg/mL range for optimal health.</p>\u000a<p>Please do get your levels tested though as soon as you can.</p>\u000a<p>And if you happen to find yourself with any of the warning signs described above or with levels of 400 or lower, you may want to boost your B12 and see what this powerful vitamin can do for you.</p>\u000a<p>You&#8217;ll discover a list of additional things you can immediately do to experience extraordinary health by <a href="http://pioneerhealthreport.com/moresecrets" target="_blank">going here</a>.</p>\u000a<p>&#160;</p>\u000a<p>&#160;</p>\u000a<p>&#160;</p>\u000a<p>Now available: <a href="http://pioneerhealthreport.com/moresecrets" target="_blank">You can get the special report</a> How to Heal Almost Anyone of Almost Anything using these 3 missing healing factors that works to reverse almost any condition.</p>\u000a<p>&#160;</p>\u000a<p>&#160;</p>\u000a                </div>

VGuest post by Linda-Anne Kahn\u000a\u000aDid you know that we are exposed to 82,000 different toxins, chemically-based products and processed foods in our environment weekly?\u000a\u000aDetoxification is the body\u2019s natural, ongoing process of eliminating harmful toxins from the body so that it can function at its best. Toxins are man-made chemicals found in the air, water, food, household cleaners and cosmetic products as well as waste products produced by normal cellular activity.\u000a\u000aWhen toxins enter the body through the skin, nasal passage or mouth, the body prevents \u201cpollution\u201d by surrounding the toxins with fat and water and stores them in different areas of the body. This can put a strain on our body\u2019s own detox system (the liver, intestines, kidneys, lungs, skin, blood and lymphatic systems). These systems can become burdened as they try to safely excrete toxins.\u000a\u000aOur bodies were not meant to work this hard to maintain optimal functioning. By adding a detox program to your wellness regimen, you can help pull these toxins, along with the excess fat and water, out of the body and improve your health quickly.\u000a\u000aThe Lymphatic System: Forgotten Hero\u000a\u000aThe lymphatic system is the most forgotten and least understood system in the body. It is critical to the detoxification process. The lymph travels parallel with the blood system and is responsible for the removal of wastes from every cell in the body, in addition to regulating the immune system. The lymph is thus a very important system to support optimal health.\u000a\u000aKeep Your Body\u2019s Drains Clean\u000a\u000aThe lymphatic system is like the garbage system of the body. Proper functioning of the lymphatic system is essential in order to properly eliminate wastes. Our lymphatic system can become and remain congested and stagnant for many years. Thus, we often live in an environment of toxins that weakens our immunity. Proper lymph drainage will eliminate these toxins and assist the body to function optimally.\u000a\u000aDigestion: Where It All Begins\u000a\u000aThe body\u2019s ability to detox starts in digestive system, in the villae of the small intestine. The \u201clacteals\u201d in the villae are part of the lymphatic system and they pull nutrients and fat-soluble toxins off the intestinal wall. If the gut is constipated or there is excessive reactive mucus bogging down the villi, the lymph and its white blood cells may not provide immunity or detoxification.\u000a\u000aThe highest concentration of lymph is found lining the outside of the gut wall and is called the Gut Associated Lymphoid Tissue (GALT). The skin of the intestinal tract is constantly being exposed to toxins and undesirable microbes that could present a problem. So, the body has an immunity army waiting in the GALT just across the wall of the gut.\u000a\u000aDr. Vodder\u2019s Manual Lymph Drainage (MLD)\u000a\u000aLymph vessels are also found under our skin throughout the body. These vessels support circulation, drainage of waste and immunity. When the lymph flow slows, the skin will appear dull and toxins will build up.\u000a\u000aSince the lymph moves against gravity, it is common for the lymph and veins to congest, yielding an unsightly appearance in the feet, legs, thighs, hips, belly and arms.\u000a\u000aDr Vodder\u2019s Manual Lymph Drainage (MLD) is a gentle rhythmical technique that gently works on the lymphatic vessels to enhance the flow of lymph throughout the body\u2019s tissues.\u000a\u000aMLD also helps to support the healthy function of the immune system and the autonomic nervous system, thereby reducing stress. The therapy cleanses the connective tissue of wastes, thus decongesting and reducing edema, pain and swelling.\u000a\u000aBenefits of Manual Lymph Drainage Therapy\u000a\u000a\u2022 Faster recovery and less scarring from surgery and other types of trauma by making lymph flow faster and stimulating the formation of new connections between lymph vessels\u000a\u000a\u2022 Clears congestive conditions such as chronic sinusitis, bronchitis, acne, and headaches\u000a\u000a\u2022 Strengthens the immune system\u000a\u000a\u2022 Relieves heaviness tightness and swelling in those suffering from lymphedema.\u000a\u000a\u2022 Increases overall relaxation by decreasing stress\u000a\u000a\u2022 Relieves retention of fluids during pregnancy and menstrual cycle\u000a\u000a\u2022 Decreases local edemas and hematomas from orthopedic surgery, cosmetic surgery scars, and burn scars; leading to a decreased in healing time and increase in client mobility\u000a\u000a\u2022 People who suffer from insomnia, stress, fibromyalgia, and autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, lupus, and rheumatism benefit greatly from MLD\u000a\u000aAs owner, founder and Medical Wellness Director of Beauty Kliniek Aromatherapy Day Spa & Wellness Center, Linda-Anne Kahn helps people achieve balance of the body, mind and spirit.

V(Natural News) A former scientist from the US Environmental Protection Agency is now reportedly working with Geoengineeringwatch.org, after being fired by the federal agency for raising concerns about a major threat to public health, namely, geoengineering.\u000a\u000aIn a statement authored for Geoengineering Watch, Davis writes that he was employed by the EPA for 16 years, and worked for the National Pollution Discharge Elimination Systems (NPDES) Programs Branch of the Water Division in Region 5, located in Chicago, Illinois.\u000a\u000aDavis states, \u201cI was terminated as a public servant performing a public service for raising the issues of anthropogenic deposition of aluminum due to atmospheric geoengineering.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe says that the issue regarding anthropogenic deposition of aluminum due to atmospheric geoengineering first reared its head in May 2013, when another employee from the NPDES Programs Branch sent a general email to everyone regarding \u201cNPDES and Climate Change.\u201d Davis sent a short reply to the email, and six weeks later, he says he received a Letter of Reprimand that accused him of \u201cmaking false, malicious and unfounded statements against colleagues, supervisors, management and elected public servants.\u201d His own supervisor said his remarks were damaging to both the integrity and the reputation of the agency.\u000a\u000aIn April 2014, a gag order was placed on Davis after he questioned why fluoride was being disposed of in the Beloit, WI water supply. He was barred from having written or verbal communication with anyone unless his supervisor approved it first. Upper management and Davis\u2019s supervisor contended that the gag order would remain in place to keep him from tarnishing the EPA\u2019s reputation and integrity any further \u2014 a rather laughable reason because, as we all know, the EPA doesn\u2019t have much of either.\u000a\u000aDavis continued to do his own research on the dangers of geoengineering and other topics and even drafted up emails describing these ill effects and sent them to his supervisor and members of upper-level management within the EPA. They were ignored six times before he got a lackluster response, which Davis says simply \u201cparroted\u201d the agency\u2019s corporate agenda.\u000a\u000aEPA ignoring other dangers\u000a\u000aIn addition to voicing his concerns about the hazardous effects of geoengineering, Davis also spoke out about the addition of noxious chemicals to the public water supply. According to Davis, an industrial hazardous waste byproduct of fluoride known as HFSA is being put into the nation\u2019s drinking water systems. He states that HFSA is sold to water utility companies by the fertilizer and aluminum industries.\u000a\u000aHFSA stands for hydrofluosilicic acid, and it is used to fluoridate public water supplies around the country. In 2013, J. William Hirzy, Ph.D., another former EPA scientist, petitioned the EPA to ban the use of HFSA in public water supplies under section 21 of the Toxic Substances Control Act.\u000a\u000aIn his petition, Hirzy stated, \u201cThe action will simultaneously prevent hundreds of cases of lung and bladder cancer through the reduction in the amount of arsenic now being delivered to our citizens who drink water that is fluoridated with hydrofluorosilicic acid (HFSA).\u201d\u000a\u000aHirzy also noted that the agency wouldn\u2019t be interfering with local government\u2019s choosing to fluoridate water by removing HFSA as an option, but that the agency would be mandating the nation\u2019s citizens not be exposed to carcinogenic substances like arsenic. Hirzy also stated that such action would put an end to use of the public water systems in the United States as \u201cextremely profitable hazardous waste disposal sites for the phosphate fertilizer manufacturing industry.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhat is the EPA really protecting?\u000a\u000aDavis, like many others, appeared to grow disenchanted with the EPA long before he was fired. He says that the agency merely \u201cwants to continue their cover-up, collusion, and criminality pertaining to pollution and contamination,\u201d which he says is being orchestrated by the multinational corporations that really control the EPA.\u000a\u000aAccording to Davis, the \u201cP\u201d in EPA stands for the \u201cprotection of corporate profits,\u201d and not the protection of people, animals and the environment. He says that like all other government agencies, the EPA is \u201ccorrupt to the core\u201d and has been completely overtaken by corporations and private interests.\u000a\u000aWhen it comes down to it, the EPA is protecting their keepers, and no one else.\u000a\u000aSources:\u000a\u000aGeoengineeringWatch.org\u000a\u000aEPA.gov

VA \u201cgravitational anomaly\u201d buried beneath the ice of Antarctica recently sent the Internet into a buzz of speculation, with suggested explanations including everything from UFOs to a gateway to the hollow center of the planet.\u000a\u000aBut the explanation suggested by scientists is perhaps more remarkable still: that the anomaly, known as the Wilkes Land mass crater, is a type of fingerprint indicating the impact of an asteroid four to five times larger than the one that wiped out the dinosaurs.\u000a\u000aThe scientists who discovered the anomaly have suggested that this asteroid could be responsible for the worst mass extinction in our planet\u2019s history, and may also have initiated the breakup of the supercontinent, Gondwana.\u000a\u000aSigns of asteroid impact\u000a\u000aIn 2006, researchers from Ohio State University were studying gravity fluctuations measured by NASA\u2019s GRACE satellites, and discovered a 200-mile wide section of land that appeared to be made of high-density material from earth\u2019s mantle, rather than the typical crust material that makes up most of the planet\u2019s surface. These mass concentrations (\u201cmascons\u201d) occur when large amounts of matter rise up from beneath the crust, and often indicate an impact from a large object.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf I saw this same mascon signal on the moon, I\u2019d expect to see a crater around it,\u201d researcher Ralph von Frese said. \u201cWhen we looked at the ice-probing airborne radar, there it was.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe researchers discovered that the mascon was sitting in the exact center of a circular ridge about 300 miles across. And while many factors could produce such geological formations, the combination of the ridge and the mascon is highly suggestive of an impact crater.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere are at least 20 impact craters this size or larger on the moon, so it is not surprising to find one here,\u201d he said. \u201cThe active geology of the Earth likely scrubbed its surface clean of many more.\u201d\u000a\u000aBecause the earth is geologically active, mascons eventually get cleared away, even before the craters that house them disappear. This property of the earth\u2019s geology allowed the researchers to estimate the time of the impact at about 250 million years ago. In another 500 million years, they said, the mascon will have disappeared entirely.\u000a\u000aThe researchers became excited when they realized that 250 million years ago is the time at which the Permian-Triassic (P-T) mass extinction event occurred, wiping out 96 percent of ocean life and 70 percent of land vertebrates.\u000a\u000aDwarfs asteroid that killed the dinosaurs\u000a\u000aScientists believe that the Cretacious-Tertiary (K-T) extinction that wiped out the dinosaurs was caused by an asteroid, dubbed Chicxulub, that struck the earth at what is now Mexico\u2019s Yucatan Peninsula. Based on analyses of craters size, Chicxulub was probably about six miles wide \u2014 compared to a 30-mile wide asteroid that likely creates the Wilkes Land mass crater.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis Wilkes Land impact is much bigger than the impact that killed the dinosaurs, and probably would have caused catastrophic damage at the time,\u201d von Frese said.\u000a\u000a\u201cAll the environmental changes that would have resulted from the impact would have created a highly caustic environment that was really hard to endure. So it makes sense that a lot of life went extinct at that time.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe scientists also noticed that the crater is bisected by a rift valley that extends into the Indian Ocean. It was the expansion of this rift that, 100 million years ago, caused Antarctica to separate from the Gondwana supercontinent. This led the researchers to suggest that perhaps the asteroid that produced the Wilkes Land mass crater actually created this rift in the first place, thus beginning the eventual breakup of Gondwana.\u000a\u000aThe researchers\u2019 theory is not universally accepted. Other potential craters have been suggested for a P-T asteroid, such as Bedout off the northwest coast of Australia. Other scientists believe that the P-T extinction was caused not by an asteroid, but by volcanic activity.\u000a\u000aSources:\u000a\u000aTheSun.co.uk\u000a\u000aResearchNews.osu.edu\u000a\u000aAstroBio.net

V(Natural News) February 2017 marks the introduction of genetically modified apples into US stores, sadly. The altered Golden Delicious apple will be the first to be test marketed, at ten Midwest locations. Okanagan Specialty Fruits is producing the latest Frankenfood, but more apple varieties are soon to follow. The FDA has approved Okanagan\u2019s GMO Granny and Fuji varieties, and approval for the Gala is expected in 2018. Exactly which stores will get the new apple is not being disclosed to the public, for reasons that aren\u2019t clear. If Okanagan has nothing to hide, why not just disclose the information in an announcement? The apples will carry the name \u2018Arctic\u2019 but if you aren\u2019t aware of this then you could be ingesting yet another unlabeled GMO.\u000a\u000aAnyone who has ever eaten an apple knows that they will start to brown within moments of the flesh being exposed to air. The browning is due to the presence of the enzyme polyphenol oxidase, which causes apples to oxidize. But the Arctic apples have been genetically tinkered with, and the enzyme has been limited by a gene silencing technique. And that is the hook for consumers who demand perfection in the appearance of the produce they eat \u2013 when sliced this new creation will not brown for three weeks. This Frankenfruit will come pre-sliced and wrapped in plastic, just the way nature intended (not). (RELATED: See more news about GMOs at GMO.news )\u000a\u000aThe GMO industry\u2019s shameful legacy of ill effects\u000a\u000aResponsibleTechnology.org lists important reasons to avoid GMOs:\u000a\u000a1 Studies on animals given GMO feed show \u201corgan damage, gastrointestinal and immune system disorders, accelerated aging, and infertility.\u201d\u000a\u000a2 GMOs cross pollinate and the contamination is permanent, threatening future generations.\u000a\u000a3 Genetically modified crops are altered to tolerate herbicides, so GM foods contain more dangerous chemicals such as Roundup, which has been linked to birth defects, infertility, and cancer.\u000a\u000a4 Genetic engineering can cause unintended consequences, such as \u201cnew toxins, allergens, carcinogens, and nutritional deficiencies.\u201d\u000a\u000a5 Perhaps most telling is that when given a choice, animals avoid eating GMO foods. These include rats, squirrels, chicken, buffalo, deer, raccoons, mice, cows, pigs, geese, and elk.\u000a\u000aPhD plant biologist Jonathan Latham writes,\u201cI wasn\u2019t, at the outset, concerned about the possible effects of GM plants on human health or the environment\u2026we hardly imagined that GMOs like ours would be grown or eaten. So far as I was concerned, all GMOs were for research purposes only. The commercial purpose of GMOs is not to feed the world or improve farming. Rather, they exist to gain intellectual property (i.e. patent rights) over seeds and plant breeding and to drive agriculture in directions that benefit agribusiness. This drive is occurring at the expense of farmers, consumers, and the natural world.\u201d\u000a\u000aMany countries around the world have banned GMO\u2019s. Yet sadly, the US leads the world in production of these insidious poisons. The problem is that when you alter a plant\u2019s DNA to produce a desirable trait, no one knows how this affects health; the science of genetic tampering is still too uninformed to predict, and unintended consequences will result because it\u2019s beyond the grasp of science to know. If enough Americans become informed on the roulette game being played out with our health and our very lives, the power of the marketplace will prevail and we can eradicate the menace of GMO\u2019s. The very idea that foods can be marketed without labeling GMO ingredients is a red flag \u2013 why the secrecy if the food is safe? If enough consumers refuse to purchase GMO foods, and they are no longer profitable, this despicable technology will cease.

VIf you work for a living, the fact that there are people who don\u2019t and instead choose to live off of government assistance is almost guaranteed to frustrate you. The fact that anyone in the United States thinks it is reasonable to force those in the workforce to pay for those who willingly choose not to work is beyond comprehension, but that is exactly what the Regressive Left believes. They are trying to shift the entire country in the direction of socialism and this is the first step.\u000a\u000aFood stamps pay for the weakest members of our society to survive without doing anything on their own. As you can probably tell from the fact that they are exploiting a welfare program, many of the people that are using food stamps aren\u2019t the best and brightest of our society. In fact, many of them appear to be complete leeches that have no desire to better themselves or the world around them. That\u2019s why it isn\u2019t particularly surprising that people that are on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) spend much more money on sugary junk food than those that are not. They are not concerned with being healthy, because they have no incentive to be.\u000a\u000aA recent study published by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) breaks down how unhealthy the eating habits of many people that are using food stamps appear to be. Jerome Hudson of Breitbart reports, \u201cOverall, SNAP users spent 22.8 percent of their benefit on sugary drinks, desserts, salty snacks, candy, sugar, plus jams and sweets, and only 11.9 percent on fruits and vegetables. Families that don\u2019t use SNAP spent 20 percent of their funds on those sweet items, and 16.3 percent on fruits and vegetables.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhile the Regressive Left has been pushing the idea that the economy is booming and that there are no problems when it comes to finance in America, statistics prove that they are completely wrong. Hudson goes on to explain, \u201cMore than 10.7 million more Americans \u2014 a 32 percent jump \u2014 have become reliant on food stamps to feed themselves since Obama took office in 2009, according to data released by the Department of Agriculture.\u201d\u000a\u000aThis is completely unacceptable. There is no reason why SNAP users should be allotted funds to spend on food that have virtually zero nutritional value. If we are going to have these kinds of welfare programs at all, they should provide their users with the bare necessities \u2014 which does not include soda and candy. If we are all about promoting healthy lifestyles in America, this is the last thing that any of us need.\u000a\u000aWhen libertarians say that taxation is theft, this kind of irresponsible spending is exactly what they are talking about. If we are going to have federal programs that use taxpayer money in order to better our country, we desperately need to analyze exactly how the money is being spent. Hopefully the Trump administration has a plan regarding how to fix these issues. Taxes need to be going down instead of up and we can no longer afford to waste money on these social programs that are being exploited beyond belief.\u000a\u000aSources:\u000a\u000aBreitbart.com\u000a\u000aNYTimes.com

Taxes need to be going down instead of up and we&#160;can no longer afford to waste money on these social programs that are being exploited beyond belief.</p>\u000a<p><strong>Sources:</strong></p>\u000a<p><a href="http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/01/15/food-stamps-billions-spent-junk-food/">Breitbart.com</a></p>\u000a<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/13/well/eat/food-stamp-snap-soda.html">NYTimes.com</a></p>\u000a\u000a \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a<p id="mc_embed_signup">\u000a \u000a</p>\u000a<p></p>\u000a<p></p>\u000a<p></p>\u000a</div>

VStarbucks recently pledged to hire 10,000 refugees over the next five years in the 75 countries where they operate. In addition to the recent pledge, the company also promises to offer continued support for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. They have guaranteed health care for their employees regardless of the Affordable Care Act, and wish to \u201cbuild bridges not walls\u201d with Mexico.\u000a\u000aMany Starbucks customers were outraged with the recent announcement and threatened to boycott the coffee chain. They feel that those 10,000 jobs should be offered to the veterans.

V(Natural News) One of nature\u2019s treasures, saffron has been known since ancient times for its bright yellow color, subtle flavor, and medicinal properties. Culinary chefs and home cooks all over the world have used this precious golden herb to enlighten their biryani, curry, paella, or risotto dish.\u000a\u000aSaffron is the world\u2019s most expensive spice, stemming from the dried orange-red stigmas of the Crocus sativus flower, which are harvested by hand. It takes about 70,000 flowers and numerous man-hours to produce one pound of dried saffron, hence the expensive price tag. Fortunately, a little bit of saffron goes a long way and it may be worth the extra cost. A group of Australian and Italian researchers found that saffron can reverse vision loss caused by age-related macular degeneration.\u000a\u000aWhile age-related macular degeneration is more common among the elderly population, this retina-destroying degenerative disease can afflict young and old. When macular degeneration affects your eyes, your sight may go blurry or dark spots can appear in your field of vision, which may ultimately lead to vision loss and blindness. But there is hope, and it is coming from a natural spice. (RELATED: Learn more about nutritional medicine at Medicine.news.)\u000a\u000aA saffron pill to reverse macular degeneration\u000a\u000aDuring a controlled, double-blind trial, including 25 individuals with macular degeneration, researchers found that daily supplementation of 20 milligrams saffron significantly improved the condition after three months. All participants experienced better vision while taking the saffron supplements.\u000a\u000aAs stated by Professor Silvia Bisti, a visiting scholar based at The Vision Centre at the University of Sydney, after saffron supplementation, patients could read one or two lines smaller than before, while others could read a book or newspaper again. She has called this study a breakthrough since it is the first time a connection has been made between antioxidant-rich saffron supplements and eyesight. She believes saffron\u2019s beneficial effect mainly comes from the ability to increase oxygen levels in the body and prevent cell death.\u000a\u000aProfessor Benedetto Falsini, who conducted the trial, however, noted that when participants stopped taking the saffron pills, the positive effects quickly wore off. Nonetheless, Falsini\u2019s results inspired Professor Bisti \u2013 in collaboration with the Catholic University of Rome and the University of L\u2019Aquila \u2013 to start another 12-month human trial to gather more information about saffron\u2019s impact on our vision and the optimal dose.\u000a\u000aFurthermore, these findings may offer new hope for people suffering genetic eye diseases, such as retinitis pigmentosa, which can induce blindness in young people. Professor Bisti\u2019s work is a continuation of research led by Professor Jonathan Stone at the University of Sydney\u2019s The Vision Lab. (RELATED: Stay informed about natural remedies at Remedies.news.)\u000a\u000aHe conducted many animal trials revealing saffron\u2019s ability to protect the eye from bright light. After decades of dedicating his time to lab tests, he is pleased to see that saffron is finally being used to help people retrieve their vision and combat macular degeneration.\u000a\u000aTo keep vision impairment and blindness at bay, Natural Blaze recommends drinking one cup of saffron tea per day. This healing, antioxidant-rich drink prevents the degeneration of the cells that take in the light while improving the function of the blood vessels supporting the eye and retina.\u000a\u000aSources:\u000a\u000aNaturalBlaze.com\u000a\u000aTelegraph.co.uk\u000a\u000aJOVS.ARVOJournals.org\u000a\u000aSydney.edu.au\u000a\u000aAOO.org

Culinary chefs and home cooks all over the world have used this precious golden herb to enlighten their biryani, curry, paella, or risotto dish.</p>\u000a<p>Saffron is the world&#8217;s most expensive spice, stemming from the dried orange-red stigmas of the Crocus sativus flower, which are harvested by hand. It takes about 70,000 flowers and numerous man-hours to produce one pound of dried saffron, hence the expensive price tag. Fortunately, a little bit of saffron goes a long way and it may be worth the extra cost. A group of Australian and Italian researchers found that saffron can reverse vision loss caused by <a href="http://science.naturalnews.com/macular_degeneration.html">age-related macular degeneration</a>.</p>\u000a<p>While age-related macular degeneration is more common among the elderly population, this retina-destroying degenerative disease can afflict young and old. When macular degeneration affects your eyes, your sight may go blurry or dark spots can appear in your field of vision, which may ultimately lead to vision loss and blindness. But there is hope, and it is coming from a natural spice. (RELATED: Learn more about&#160;<a href="http://medicine.news/">nutritional medicine at Medicine.news</a>.)</p>\u000a<h2>A saffron pill to reverse macular degeneration</h2>\u000a<p>During <a href="http://iovs.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2126253">a controlled, double-blind trial</a>, including 25 individuals with macular degeneration, researchers found that daily supplementation of 20 milligrams saffron significantly improved the condition after three months. All participants experienced better vision while taking the saffron supplements.</p>\u000a<p>As stated by Professor Silvia Bisti, a visiting scholar based at The Vision Centre at the University of Sydney, after saffron supplementation, patients could read one or two lines smaller than before, while others could read a book or newspaper again. She has called this study a breakthrough since it is the first time a connection has been made between antioxidant-rich saffron supplements and eyesight. She believes saffron&#8217;s beneficial effect mainly comes from the ability to increase oxygen levels in the body and prevent cell death.</p>\u000a<p>Professor Benedetto Falsini, who conducted the trial, however, noted that when participants stopped taking the saffron pills, the positive effects quickly wore off. Nonetheless, Falsini&#8217;s results inspired Professor Bisti &#8211; in collaboration with the Catholic University of Rome and the University of L&#8217;Aquila &#8211; to start another 12-month human trial to gather more information about saffron&#8217;s impact on our vision and the optimal dose.</p>\u000a<p>Furthermore, these findings may offer new hope for people suffering genetic eye diseases, such as retinitis pigmentosa, which can induce blindness in young people. Professor Bisti&#8217;s work is a continuation of research led by Professor Jonathan Stone at the University of Sydney&#8217;s The Vision Lab. (RELATED: Stay informed about&#160;<a href="http://remedies.news/">natural remedies at Remedies.news</a>.)</p>\u000a<p>He conducted many animal trials revealing saffron&#8217;s ability to protect the eye from bright light. After decades of dedicating his time to lab tests, he is pleased to see that saffron is finally being used to help people retrieve their vision and combat macular degeneration.</p>\u000a<p>To keep vision impairment and blindness at bay, Natural Blaze recommends drinking one cup of saffron tea per day. This <a href="http://www.antioxidants.news/">healing, antioxidant-rich</a> drink prevents the degeneration of the cells that take in the light while improving the function of the blood vessels supporting the eye and retina.</p>\u000a<p><strong>Sources:</strong></p>\u000a<p><a href="http://www.naturalblaze.com/2017/02/saffron-increase-vision-macular-degeneration.html">NaturalBlaze.com</a></p>\u000a<p><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/11214920/Saffron-the-spice-beyond-price.html">Telegraph.co.uk</a></p>\u000a<p><a href="http://iovs.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2126253">JOVS.ARVOJournals.org</a></p>\u000a<p><a href="http://sydney.edu.au/news/84.html?newsstoryid=4452">Sydney.edu.au</a></p>\u000a<p><a href="https://www.aao.org/eye-health/diseases/amd-macular-degeneration">AOO.org</a></p>\u000a \u000a</div>

VRep. Louie Gohmert (R-TX) told Breitbart News Daily he was \u201cexcited\u201d by President Donald Trump\u2019s choice of Neil Gorsuch for the Supreme Court.\u000a\u000a(Article by John Hayward from Breitbart.com)\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is exactly why I got behind Donald Trump,\u201d he told SiriusXM host Alex Marlow. \u201cThis is why I was excited election night, is because we all expected Trump to keep his word. He has. He picked somebody from the list, and, in fact, he didn\u2019t just pick somebody from the list; he may have picked the very best person from the list.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is a man that, as far as we know, has not ruled on an abortion case, but we know from what he has ruled on that he believes in the Constitution,\u201d Gohmert noted. \u201cHe believes that we have a right to religious freedom. Just as the government\u2019s not to establish a religion, they\u2019re not to prohibit the free exercise. We\u2019ve had some justices \u2013 we\u2019ve still got them on the court \u2013 that believe that the government can restrict the peaceful exercise and they can force people to go against their religious beliefs. If Hillary Clinton had made this selection, I think our religious freedom would be over. But it\u2019s not.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWe have a good man. This guy is such a good candidate,\u201d he declared. \u201cI know the President and others have said he may be able to rule as a Supreme Court justice for maybe 30 more years. I\u2019m hoping 40 years! I\u2019m going to be praying for his good health.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd I\u2019m simply praying that the Senate will do their jobs and get this guy confirmed. They confirmed him ten years ago,\u201d Gohmert pointed out. \u201cThey had reviewed for anything that they\u2019d like to bring against him ten years ago because he was going to be on the Court of Appeals, and those are critically important positions. There wasn\u2019t anything there ten years ago. Once he\u2019s on the Court of Appeals, then every Court of Appeals justice has in the back of their minds, \u2018You know, I could be on the Supreme Court someday. I\u2019d better keep my nose clean.\u2019 And so it ought to be a very uneventful hearing.\u201d\u000a\u000aGohmert recalled that he was originally a supporter of Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) for president in 2016, having \u201cfought in the trenches\u201d with him, but now, he wondered how any serious conservative could complain about President Trump\u2019s selection of Gorsuch for the Supreme Court. In light of this nomination, he pronounced the \u201cNeverTrump\u201d movement among some conservatives a \u201cdisastrous mistake.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThank goodness those who said, \u2018Never Trump\u2019 did not keep him from being president because that would have been the end of too much,\u201d he said. \u201cSo those who were NeverTrumpers, fine; everybody\u2019s entitled to your opinion, but at least you ought to get out there and acknowledge now, \u2018Well, I wasn\u2019t for Trump, but thankfully, he actually did keep his word, and we can all be grateful for that.\u2019\u201d\u000a\u000aGohmert said friends in the Senate told him they will make sure Gorsuch gets through the confirmation process, along with President Trump\u2019s remaining cabinet nominees. One senator told him it was important to give Majority Leader Mitch McConnell space and time to shepherd the nominations through in his own way, rather than pressuring him for swift action and fiery confrontations with the Democrats.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe thing about this nomination, it\u2019s replacing Antonin Scalia,\u201d he said of Gorsuch. \u201cThe Left was pretty well getting their way with the courts, even with Scalia on there, being as conservative and originalist as he was.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThere\u2019s a kind of feeling that I\u2019m hearing about among some of the Democrats, especially those that are in states that voted for Trump, that, look, this shouldn\u2019t be the one that we fight over,\u201d he added. \u201cIf it\u2019s Ginsburg, then we fight to the death to prevent a conservative, but this is Scalia. We\u2019re not losing anything by getting somebody that might be close to being as conservative as Scalia. So this shouldn\u2019t be where we fight to the death to keep him from being a vote, and this also could be the one that brings those senators that are Democrats in states that voted for Trump, it could be just what brings them down and turns their seat Republican.\u201d\u000a\u000aGohmert did not think much of the Democrat claim that Gorsuch is an illegitimate nominee for a seat that was \u201cstolen\u201d from President Barack Obama\u2019s designated successor to Scalia, Merrick Garland.\u000a\u000a\u201cLast night, I came by the Supreme Court about 9:15, and they already had a massive demonstration out there, signs; they were ready to go. They had their magic markers. They were ready to put whoever\u2019s name had been cited by Trump as being terrible,\u201d he observed. \u201cYou know, Have Poster Board, Will Travel. There they were. They were ready to condemn anybody, no matter who had been picked. If Trump had named the most left-wing person in the country, they were out there ready to condemn.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is fake news. This is people who are just out there to create the appearance of obstruction,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, Patrick Poole, remember back in one of the demonstrations on the Mall, caught one of the guys: \u2018Hey, how much are you getting paid?\u2019 He said, \u2018$15 an hour. I thought everybody was getting that.\u2019 They\u2019re getting paid. The Soros money gets spread around. And actually, unfortunately, sometimes it\u2019s our own government money that\u2019s funding some of the obstructionism. But we have got to see this country through this and get Gorsuch confirmed so that this country will go on and still have a chance to survive, with our freedom intact,\u201d he urged.\u000a\u000aGohmert noted that every Democrat seems to be reading from a script that Gorsuch\u2019s prospective Supreme Court seat \u201cwas supposed to be Obama\u2019s seat to fill,\u201d as Marlow noted.\u000a\u000a\u201cThey have the mantra. They might as well have been carrying their statements on a sign, and all they had to do was fill in the blank for the name,\u201d he said, predicting that virtually every Democrat statement about Gorsuch will be prefaced with stolen-seat \u201cgarbage.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019m thanking God he got elected, and he\u2019s keeping his word,\u201d Gohmert said of President Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s a day to rejoice for any Republican, anyone who\u2019s a moderate, because otherwise, we get a leftist, and we\u2019re done. So it\u2019s a great day for America. It just really is.\u201d\u000a\u000aBreitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.\u000a\u000aLISTEN:\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aRead more at: Breitbart.com\u000a\u000aFollow more news about George Soros at Soros.news.

VMost of us know that consumer spending makes up something like 70 percent of our $17 trillion annual economy, but have you ever really wondered what most Americans spend their money on?\u000a\u000aA new chart put together by HowMuch.net (above) shows a breakdown of spending into a dozen categories, in this order: Reading; Alcohol; Tobacco; Education; Personal Care; Miscellaneous; Recreation & Entertainment; Healthcare; Clothing; Food; Transportation; Housing.\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s more, the categories are dissected further into spending by year, beginning in 1941 and ending in 2014. Also, as you can see, each category has been color-coded.\u000a\u000aAs reported by The AntiMedia, the chart was created using data collected from the Bureau of Labor Statitics, which is a division of the U.S. Department of Labor. Known as the Consumer Expenditure Survey, which actually consists of a pair of surveys, they \u201cprovide information on the buying habits of America\u2019s consumers, including data on their expenditures, income, and consumer unit (families and single consumers) characteristics,\u201d the BLS says in its website.\u000a\u000aAll data included in the chart was adjusted for inflation; the median spending for all Americans was measured.\u000a\u000aYou won\u2019t believe what categories have risen\u2014and fallen\u2014over the decades\u000a\u000aAs you might have guessed, spending on housing are traditionally the largest in any household, and it\u2019s been that way for the past seven decades. There was one exception to that trend: 1941, when food spending averaged $8,311 for the year versus $7,537 for housing.\u000a\u000aBut that same year the government statisticians included alcohol in with food spending, which unduly inflates that figure for what became the year the United States entered World War II. Following 1941, alcohol spending was made a separate line item.\u000a\u000aWhat is also interesting is how Americans have gradually begun spending less on clothing. For this category, the chart shows that spending on clothing peaked in 1961, with an average of $4,157. But in each year since then, clothes spending has dropped of steadily, even when inflation was counted.\u000a\u000aOver a similar period, however, spending on education began rising steadily, as more Americans chose college and technical schools to further their training after high school. Included in the upward trend were transportation and healthcare.\u000a\u000aBut education spending increased at a much faster clip than any other category, climbing from $242 in 1941 to $1,236 in 2014. Between 1984 and 1994, education spending really took off, but the upward trend continued.\u000a\u000aSpending on healthcare, meanwhile, rose overall between 1941 and 2014, but spending on healthcare dropped between 1973 and 1984 (providing healthcare reformers an opportunity to study that period and figure out why the drop occurred). Healthcare spending rose dramatically after 1984 (again\u2026why?).\u000a\u000aWhat the chart also shows is that during the measured timeframe Americans pretty much spent their money on the same things. Housing has endured as a big annual cost for consumers, followed by food.\u000a\u000aOnline commerce taking big bite out of traditional stores\u000a\u000aAs for the economy in general, consumer spending has risen and fallen with the economic times. In November, for instance, spending rose but only by about 0.2 percent, which was the weakest since the 0.1 percent increase in August, according to the Commerce Department. Spending rose last month, of course, in response to the Holiday season.\u000a\u000aOne other consumer spending trend that has risen over the past 20 years: Online shopping.\u000a\u000aWBIR, an NBC affiliate, reported this month that as online retail sales have continued to grow (as they have at our own online retail location), that is hurting traditional brick-and-mortar retail outlets as they lose out to E-retailers like Amazon.com and others.\u000a\u000aBill Fox, director of the Boyd Center for Business & Economic Research, told the affiliate that holiday sales for 2016 indicated a double-digit growth in e-commerce, while sales of in-store items showed basically no growth at all.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou and I want this option. I mean, that\u2019s why it\u2019s growing so fast,\u201d Fox said. \u201cWe like shopping online, and we see companies finding new ways to help us take advantage of that.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe added that didn\u2019t mean that brick-and-mortar retailers would become a thing of the past anytime soon, but it does mean traditional stores will have less of a retail footprint going forward.\u000a\u000aSources:\u000a\u000aTheAntiMedia.org\u000a\u000aABCNews.go.com\u000a\u000aBusinessInsider.com

Also, as you can see, each category has been color-coded.</p>\u000a<p>As reported by The AntiMedia, <a href="http://theantimedia.org/americans-spent-money-75-years/">the chart was created using data</a> collected from the Bureau of Labor Statitics, which is a division of the U.S. Department of Labor. Known as the Consumer Expenditure Survey, which actually consists of a pair of surveys, they &#8220;provide information on the buying habits of America&#8217;s consumers, including data on their expenditures, income, and consumer unit (families and single consumers) characteristics,&#8221; the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/cex/">BLS says in its website</a>.</p>\u000a<p>All data included in the chart was adjusted for inflation; the median spending for all Americans was measured.</p>\u000a<h2><strong>You won&#8217;t believe what categories have risen&#8212;and fallen&#8212;over the decades</strong></h2>\u000a<p>As you might have guessed, spending on housing are traditionally the largest in any household, and it&#8217;s been that way for the past seven decades. There was one exception to that trend: 1941, when food spending averaged $8,311 for the year versus $7,537 for housing.</p>\u000a<p>But that same year the government statisticians included alcohol in with food spending, which unduly inflates that figure for what became the year the United States entered World War II. Following 1941, alcohol spending was made a separate line item.</p>\u000a<p>What is also interesting is how Americans have gradually begun spending less on clothing. For this category, the chart shows that spending on clothing peaked in 1961, with an average of $4,157. But in each year since then, clothes spending has dropped of steadily, even when inflation was counted.</p>\u000a<p>Over a similar period, however, spending on <a href="http://www.homeschooling.news/">education</a> began rising steadily, as more Americans chose college and technical schools to further their training after high school. Included in the upward trend were transportation and healthcare.</p>\u000a<p>But education spending increased at a much faster clip than any other category, climbing from $242 in 1941 to $1,236 in 2014. Between 1984 and 1994, education spending really took off, but the upward trend continued.</p>\u000a<p>Spending on healthcare, meanwhile, rose overall between 1941 and 2014, but spending on healthcare dropped between 1973 and 1984 (providing healthcare reformers an opportunity to study that period and figure out why the drop occurred). Healthcare spending rose dramatically after 1984 (again&#8230;why?).</p>\u000a<p>What the chart also shows is that during the measured timeframe Americans pretty much spent their money on the same things. Housing has endured as a big annual cost for consumers, followed by food.</p>\u000a<h2><strong>Online commerce taking big bite out of traditional stores</strong></h2>\u000a<p>As for the economy in general, consumer spending has risen and fallen with the economic times. In November, for instance, spending rose but only by about 0.2 percent, which was the weakest since the 0.1 percent increase in August, <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/consumers-slow-growth-spending-november-44345407">according to the Commerce Department</a>. Spending rose last month, of course, <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/december-consumer-spending-is-looking-like-a-win-for-retailers-2016-12">in response to the Holiday season</a>.</p>\u000a<p>One other consumer spending trend that has risen over the past 20 years: Online shopping.</p>\u000a<p>WBIR, an NBC affiliate, <a href="http://www.wbir.com/news/local/online-sales-grow-as-companies-try-to-keep-up/381833942">reported this month</a> that as online retail sales have continued to grow (as they have <a href="http://www.healthrangerstore.com/">at our own online retail location</a>), that is hurting traditional brick-and-mortar retail outlets as they lose out to E-retailers like Amazon.com and others.</p>\u000a<p>Bill Fox, director of the Boyd Center for Business &amp; Economic Research, told the affiliate that holiday sales for 2016 indicated a double-digit growth in e-commerce, while sales of in-store items showed basically no growth at all.</p>\u000a<p>&#8220;You and I want this option. I mean, that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s growing so fast,&#8221; Fox said. &#8220;We like shopping online, and we see companies finding new ways to help us take advantage of that.&#8221;</p>\u000a<p>He added that didn&#8217;t mean that brick-and-mortar retailers would become a thing of the past anytime soon, but it does mean traditional stores will have less of a retail footprint going forward.</p>\u000a<p><strong>Sources:</strong></p>\u000a<p><a href="http://theantimedia.org/americans-spent-money-75-years/">TheAntiMedia.org</a></p>\u000a<p><a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/consumers-slow-growth-spending-november-44345407">ABCNews.go.com</a></p>\u000a<p><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/december-consumer-spending-is-looking-like-a-win-for-retailers-2016-12">BusinessInsider.com</a></p>\u000a\u000a \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a<p id="mc_embed_signup">\u000a \u000a</p>\u000a<p></p>\u000a<p></p>\u000a<p></p>\u000a</div>

VIndoctrinating children with yet more totally stupid ideas\u000a\u000aIf you fly on commercial airlines, you are flying with a man who has a gun on the airplane\u000a\u000aEmpowering students? Or getting them shot?\u000a\u000aShould police trade in their Glocks for Campbell's Soup cans?\u000a\u000aCan children even throw soup with any force or accuracy?\u000a\u000aShouldn't teachers also be armed with soup cans, too?\u000a\u000aIt's all a symptom of a broken, delusional society of people trained to think like victims\u000a\u000aImagined conversation with terrorists\u000a\u000aHere's the original letter from W. T. F. Burns Middle Schools\u000a\u000a(NaturalNews) The latest loony idea from "gun-free zone" advocates (who absolutely insist on making children a target in public schools by advertising the utter lack of armed defenses there) involves training children to function asusing cans of soup as weapons.I'm seriously not making this up.See the letter from the principal of the W. F. Burns Middle School below, which explains all.As the letter explains, instead of allowing responsible school administrators who pass FBI background checks to carry concealed firearms that could immediately take down active shooters who are endangering children, "gun-free zone" delusional thinkers want to turn classrooms of children intotrained to hurl Campbell's Soup cans at armed attackers.This insanely stupid idea is described in a letter that has surfaced from the principal of the W.F. Burns Middle School in Alabama -- click here to see the letter for yourself (h/t to Buzzpo.com, links below) -- which states the school is now "enhancing our procedure for intruders."This new procedure will involve "...arming our students with a canned food item."It is never explained how a group of obese students who can't even toss a basketball into a hoop are supposed to nail the heads of attackers with pinpoint accuracy using aerodynamically-unstable soup cans. Will they be trained for it? Are America's middle schools seriously going to start their own home-grow militia defense training with students hurling soup cans to the audible commands of teachers screaming, "Achtung!"For those who question the term "militia" here, the definition of a militia is a home-grown armed citizenry organized for the purpose of self-defense. That definition applies almost perfectly to the situation being covered here.The entire idea of these armed, soup-wielding militia defense forces boils down to the typical victimization mindset that's consistently advocated by wishy-washy bureaucrats who hate self-defense and self-reliance. The way this works, we are told, is that "The canned food item could stun the intruder or even knock him out until the police arrive. The canned food item will give students a sense of empowerment to protect themselves and will make them feel secure in case an intruder enters their classroom."Feel free to vomit right now, if you wish. Yes, this is the feel-good emotional crap that government schools are force-feeding our children these days because apparently it's more important for children to feel good about themselves while they are being mass murdered than to really stop an armed attacker.Where to even begin in dissecting the nonsense in all this? For starters, a typical police response time to an active shooter in a school is more than six minutes. During those six minutes, how many soup-hurling children might be shot by a crazed, armed intruder intent on causing mayhem and death?The victimization psychology of school officials is obvious in the claim that this will somehow buy the students time "until the police arrive." Because as all obedient "gun-free zone" advocates know, only the police can be allowed to take responsibility for the defense of human life, right? The idea of allowing a responsible, well-trained teacher or school administrator to pack a pistol is abhorrent to these people even though it's the most sensible idea of all.Everyone who flies on commercial airlines is sitting on a plane with precisely the same kind of armed person. They're calledand they carry loaded guns onto airplanes for the purpose of stopping violence. The idea of an armedis similarly well-founded, and School Marshals could be specially-trained and certified school administrators, coaches or teachers who pass background checks and receive exhaustive training on protecting children from active shooters.But no, government school bureaucrats are so terrified of the physical object known as a gun -- which they foolishly think will magically just "go off" on its own, at random times -- that they can't fathom the idea thatThat's why the police carry them, obviously. If guns weren't useful tools for stopping violence, then there is no point arming police in the first place. In fact, the entire reason school administrators call 911 isand use those guns to stop violence.But my favorite part of this letter is how school administrators think teaching students to hurl cans of soup at armed attackers would "give students a sense of empowerment" and will "make them feel secure..."Wow. Is this more touchy-feely fuzzy math being applied to an active shooter scenario?As someone who is well trained in handgun combat tactics (as well as organic permaculture gardening, laboratory protocols, yoga and many other arts), let me explain something to the principal of the W. F. Burns Middle School. By training children to throw objects at an armed assailant,The only correct response by children to an active shooter scenario is for those children toThe idea of recruiting these schoolchildren into some sort of Campbell's Soup army of adolescent resistance forces is wholly insane. Training children to confront armed attackers with cans of soup is dangerously irresponsible and wildly illogical. It's obvious the people who came up with this foolishness have no experience whatsoever with firearms or shooter scenarios. This focus on giving students a "sense of empowerment" with canned food will only get them killed.It also brings up the obvious question: If children get killed while hurling Campbell's Soup cans during a firefight,After all, if the soup is now being officially sanctioned as a "weapon," then won't some lawyer claim the soup can "malfunctioned" when it didn't knock out the intruder, leading to the death of some innocent children?I can only imagine how frustrated the soup companies are going to be when they find out government schools are calling for their cans to be used as weapons of self defense even though cans of soup have never in the history of the world been demonstrated to have any defensive properties whatsoever. Pretty soon we're likely to see warning labels on the sides of soup cans stating something like, "NOT FOR USE as kinetic weapons against armed intruders."The letter actually requests that parents "arm" their children with cans of food. "We are asking each student to bring an 8 oz. canned food item (corn, beans, peas, etc.) to use in case an intruder enters their classroom."Now, I can understand the idea that most modern processed food is so toxic and laced with deadly chemicals that it might be harmful to EAT it. But hurling it as a kinetic weapon against an attacker wielding an AK-47, for example, is just stupid beyond belief.If canned soup was so good at stopping attackers, thenI know a lot of cops. But I have never seen one carry a can of soup on their belt holster. I mean, yeah, cops will "go Batman" and carry more crap than you can imagine on their belt holsters, but even then, I've never seen one wearing soup.Anyway, the children should be fleeing the attacker, not confronting him. So teaching them to "stand your ground" with a can of soup is a recipe for disaster.The idea of recruiting schoolchildren into a local militia of armed resistance fighters is just whacko to begin with.Have you ever witnessed a gym class of today's seventh graders? I'd be surprised if even 1 in 20 could hit a human head-sized target with a can of soup hurled across a classroom. Even if you hit the intruder, the most likely result of that is to justThe loony idea being promoted by school administrators that "The canned food item could stun the intruder or even knock him out until the police arrive..." is based on the same sort of delusional thinking that government-run schools are training students to embrace in all other areas: economics, science, mathematics, writing proficiency, etc. Is it no wonder that most college students today can only read at a seventh-grade level?To add another layer of "feel good" community-centric emotional progressivism to this entire pathetic scheme, the letter says, "At the end of the school year, the cans will be donated to the food closet."Does that still apply if the cans have holes shot through them and are covered with the blood of students who died while trying to hurl them at armed assailants instead of fleeing the scene like they should have done?I applaud the idea of keeping children safe, but training students to function as resistance militia forces with what are essentially stone-age kinetic weapons is one of the most outrageously dangerous and ill-conceived ideas I've ever seen come out of a public school. And there are some real whoppers competing with that title, such as the "New Math" or whatever it's called where it's more important for students to feel good about the process rather than arrive at the correct answer.If you really want to keep children safe in schools, the solutions are not very complicated. Every modern society around the world has overwhelmingly concluded thatThis is the fundamental reasoning behind having police in the first place. Or Air Marshals. Or concealed carry holders who stop crime and stop violence without costing the government anything at all.The way to keep children safe is to put firearms in the hands of trained, trustworthy adults at the schools who canto armed intruders. Remove the ill-conceived "gun-free zone" signs, start a "School Marshals" training program, and let qualified, fully-vetted school administrators carry some heat for a change. And teach the students toAnything else is just plain stupid.If you really want to see the lunacy of the "armed with a can of soup" idea, then ask yourself this question: If arming children with cans of soup is such a great idea, thenYep, this is the new school defense plan in the gun-free zones: Teachers armed with Pork & Beans, standing in school hallways, hurling GMOs and monosodium glutamate at violent terrorists, hoping for a lucky konk on the head that causes a six-minute window of unconsciousness during which the teachers can call 911 and wait for the cops to arrive so the cops can bring the guns into the gun-free zone.You just gotta love the multiple layers of delusional thinking in this whole plan.If it were really a gun-free zone, then why don't teachers and school administrators insist that the cops leave all their guns outside the school? Obviously it's not really a gun-free zone, because when there's trouble, they wantThere are all sorts of other problems with this plan, as pointed out by Eric Reed of Buzzpo.com , who writes:Tell these school administrators to stop endangering children with loony soup hurling ideas:Principal Holley's email: holleypp@chambersk12.orgAsst. Principal Bell's email: belldo@chambersk12.orgWhat I really see in this letter -- and the loony idea of recruiting students into a resistance militia of soup-hurlers -- is a symptom of a broken society where everyone is trained into a victimization-obedience psychological thought pattern.One of the many disempowering things schools teach children is that they are subjects of a system that controls their thoughts, their beliefs, their behaviors and even their dietary choices. It is a natural extension of this indoctrination training to believe that you are helpless against armed assailants.But this belief is a delusion. In reality,that empower even frail senior citizens with the ability to. A firearm can accomplish what a can of catapulted soup cannot: it can STOP the attacker almost instantly.After all, if you're going to advocate kinetic energy as a tool to be used in schools to stop attackers, it's ridiculous to limit yourself to the kinetic weapons of the stone age. If you're going to use kinetic energy to halt an attacker, the obvious choice for delivering that kinetic energy to the intended target is a firearm in the hands of a trained adult. Or, I suppose, you could build Medieval catapults in each classroom and load them up with buckets of canned soup. That would make for an interesting physics class, but it wouldn't do much in terms of actual classroom defense.The advantage of firearms is not just in the kinetic energy delivered to the target (Energy equals one-half of mass times velocity squared , remember?) but also. Most people trained on handguns can put a 9mm round into a six-inch diameter circle at 20 - 25 feet away without much difficulty. If the point is to stop the attacker, then why don't school administrators want to stop them as rapidly and accurately as possible?Here's how delusional school administrators imagine terrorists might talk about selecting which schools to shoot up.Terrorist #1: How about we shoot up that middle school down on the corner of 5th street?Terrorist #2: No, we can't. They've got a "gun-free zone" posted.Terrorist #1: Dang.Terrorist #2: Yeah, I know. It blows.Terrorist #1: Well, what if we just ignore the sign?Terrorist #2: Can we really do that? Isn't that against the rules?Terrorist #1: What rules? We are planning a massacre, remember. I'm pretty sure that's against the rules.Terrorist #2: Yeah, you might be right! We can just ignore the "gun-free zone" sign and walk right in there!Terrorist #1: Oh, but hold on.

V<div><p class="SBAArticle"></p>&#13;\u000a(NaturalNews) The latest loony idea from "gun-free zone" advocates (who absolutely insist on making children a target in public schools by advertising the utter lack of armed defenses there) involves training children to function as <b>school resistance militia forces</b> using cans of soup as weapons.<br><br>I'm seriously not making this up.<br><br>See the letter from the principal of the W. F. Burns Middle School below, which explains all.<br><br>As the letter explains, instead of allowing responsible school administrators who pass FBI background checks to carry concealed firearms that could immediately take down active shooters who are endangering children, "gun-free zone" delusional thinkers want to turn classrooms of children into <b>school militias of soup-wielding combatants</b> trained to hurl Campbell's Soup cans at armed attackers.<br><br>This insanely stupid idea is described in a letter that has surfaced from the principal of the W.F. Burns Middle School in Alabama -- <a></a><br><br>This new procedure will involve "...arming our students with a canned food item."<br><br>It is never explained how a group of obese students who can't even toss a basketball into a hoop are supposed to nail the heads of attackers with pinpoint accuracy using aerodynamically-unstable soup cans. Will they be trained for it? Are America's middle schools seriously going to start their own home-grow militia defense training with students hurling soup cans to the audible commands of teachers screaming, "Achtung!"<br><br>For those who question the term "militia" here, the definition of a militia is a home-grown armed citizenry organized for the purpose of self-defense. That definition applies almost perfectly to the situation being covered here.<br><br><h1>Indoctrinating children with yet more totally stupid ideas</h1>The entire idea of these armed, soup-wielding militia defense forces boils down to the typical victimization mindset that's consistently advocated by wishy-washy bureaucrats who hate self-defense and self-reliance. The way this works, we are told, is that "The canned food item could stun the intruder or even knock him out until the police arrive. The canned food item will give students a sense of empowerment to protect themselves and will make them feel secure in case an intruder enters their classroom."<br><br>Feel free to vomit right now, if you wish. Yes, this is the feel-good emotional crap that government schools are force-feeding our children these days because apparently it's more important for children to feel good about themselves while they are being mass murdered than to really stop an armed attacker.<br><br>Where to even begin in dissecting the nonsense in all this? For starters, a typical police response time to an active shooter in a school is more than six minutes. During those six minutes, how many soup-hurling children might be shot by a crazed, armed intruder intent on causing mayhem and death?<br><br>The victimization psychology of school officials is obvious in the claim that this will somehow buy the students time "until the police arrive." Because as all obedient "gun-free zone" advocates know, only the police can be allowed to take responsibility for the defense of human life, right? The idea of allowing a responsible, well-trained teacher or school administrator to pack a pistol is abhorrent to these people even though it's the most sensible idea of all.<br><br><h1>If you fly on commercial airlines, you are flying with a man who has a gun on the airplane</h1>Everyone who flies on commercial airlines is sitting on a plane with precisely the same kind of armed person. They're called <b>Air Marshals</b> and they carry loaded guns onto airplanes for the purpose of stopping violence. The idea of an armed <b>School Marshal</b> is similarly well-founded, and School Marshals could be specially-trained and certified school administrators, coaches or teachers who pass background checks and receive exhaustive training on protecting children from active shooters.<br><br>But no, government school bureaucrats are so terrified of the physical object known as a gun -- which they foolishly think will magically just "go off" on its own, at random times -- that they can't fathom the idea that <b>guns can be used to protect the lives of children</b>.<br><br>That's why the police carry them, obviously. If guns weren't useful tools for stopping violence, then there is no point arming police in the first place. In fact, the entire reason school administrators call 911 is <b>because they desperately want MEN WITH GUNS to arrive on the scene as quickly as possible</b> and use those guns to stop violence.<br><br><h1>Empowering students? Or getting them shot?</h1>But my favorite part of this letter is how school administrators think teaching students to hurl cans of soup at armed attackers would "give students a sense of empowerment" and will "make them feel secure..."<br><br>Wow. Is this more touchy-feely fuzzy math being applied to an active shooter scenario?<br><br>As someone who is well trained in handgun combat tactics (as well as organic permaculture gardening, laboratory protocols, yoga and many other arts), let me explain something to the principal of the W. F. Burns Middle School. By training children to throw objects at an armed assailant, <b>you are going to get more of these kids killed.</b><br><br>The only correct response by children to an active shooter scenario is for those children to <b>evade, flee or hide</b>.<br><br>The idea of recruiting these schoolchildren into some sort of Campbell's Soup army of adolescent resistance forces is wholly insane. Training children to confront armed attackers with cans of soup is dangerously irresponsible and wildly illogical. It's obvious the people who came up with this foolishness have no experience whatsoever with firearms or shooter scenarios. This focus on giving students a "sense of empowerment" with canned food will only get them killed.<br><br>It also brings up the obvious question: If children get killed while hurling Campbell's Soup cans during a firefight, <b>will the Campbell's Soup company be sued for negligence in causing the death of the children?</b> After all, if the soup is now being officially sanctioned as a "weapon," then won't some lawyer claim the soup can "malfunctioned" when it didn't knock out the intruder, leading to the death of some innocent children?<br><br>I can only imagine how frustrated the soup companies are going to be when they find out government schools are calling for their cans to be used as weapons of self defense even though cans of soup have never in the history of the world been demonstrated to have any defensive properties whatsoever. Pretty soon we're likely to see warning labels on the sides of soup cans stating something like, "NOT FOR USE as kinetic weapons against armed intruders."<br><br><h1>Should police trade in their Glocks for Campbell's Soup cans?</h1>The letter actually requests that parents "arm" their children with cans of food. "We are asking each student to bring an 8 oz. canned food item (corn, beans, peas, etc.) to use in case an intruder enters their classroom."<br><br>Now, I can understand the idea that most modern processed food is so toxic and laced with deadly chemicals that it might be harmful to EAT it. But hurling it as a kinetic weapon against an attacker wielding an AK-47, for example, is just stupid beyond belief.<br><br>If canned soup was so good at stopping attackers, then <b>police would be armed with soup cans instead of Glocks</b>.<br><br>I know a lot of cops. But I have never seen one carry a can of soup on their belt holster. I mean, yeah, cops will "go Batman" and carry more crap than you can imagine on their belt holsters, but even then, I've never seen one wearing soup.<br><br>Anyway, the children should be fleeing the attacker, not confronting him. So teaching them to "stand your ground" with a can of soup is a recipe for disaster.<br><br><h1>Can children even throw soup with any force or accuracy?</h1>The idea of recruiting schoolchildren into a local militia of armed resistance fighters is just whacko to begin with.<br><br>Have you ever witnessed a gym class of today's seventh graders? I'd be surprised if even 1 in 20 could hit a human head-sized target with a can of soup hurled across a classroom. Even if you hit the intruder, the most likely result of that is to just <b>agitate him even more</b>.<br><br>The loony idea being promoted by school administrators that "The canned food item could stun the intruder or even knock him out until the police arrive..." is based on the same sort of delusional thinking that government-run schools are training students to embrace in all other areas: economics, science, mathematics, writing proficiency, etc. Is it no wonder that most college students today can only read at a seventh-grade level?<br><br>To add another layer of "feel good" community-centric emotional progressivism to this entire pathetic scheme, the letter says, "At the end of the school year, the cans will be donated to the food closet."<br><br>Does that still apply if the cans have holes shot through them and are covered with the blood of students who died while trying to hurl them at armed assailants instead of fleeing the scene like they should have done?<br><br>I applaud the idea of keeping children safe, but training students to function as resistance militia forces with what are essentially stone-age kinetic weapons is one of the most outrageously dangerous and ill-conceived ideas I've ever seen come out of a public school. And there are some real whoppers competing with that title, such as the "New Math" or whatever it's called where it's more important for students to feel good about the process rather than arrive at the correct answer.<br><br>If you really want to keep children safe in schools, the solutions are not very complicated. Every modern society around the world has overwhelmingly concluded that <b>the way to stop bad people with guns is to arm good people with guns</b>.<br><br>This is the fundamental reasoning behind having police in the first place. Or Air Marshals. Or concealed carry holders who stop crime and stop violence without costing the government anything at all.<br><br>The way to keep children safe is to put firearms in the hands of trained, trustworthy adults at the schools who can <b>respond immediately</b> to armed intruders. Remove the ill-conceived "gun-free zone" signs, start a "School Marshals" training program, and let qualified, fully-vetted school administrators carry some heat for a change. And teach the students to <b>hide, flee or evade.</b><br><br>Anything else is just plain stupid.<br><br><h1>Shouldn't teachers also be armed with soup cans, too?</h1>If you really want to see the lunacy of the "armed with a can of soup" idea, then ask yourself this question: If arming children with cans of soup is such a great idea, then <b>why not arm the teachers with cans of soup, too?</b><br><br>Yep, this is the new school defense plan in the gun-free zones: Teachers armed with Pork &amp; Beans, standing in school hallways, hurling GMOs and monosodium glutamate at violent terrorists, hoping for a lucky konk on the head that causes a six-minute window of unconsciousness during which the teachers can call 911 and wait for the cops to arrive so the cops can bring the guns into the gun-free zone.<br><br>You just gotta love the multiple layers of delusional thinking in this whole plan.<br><br>If it were really a gun-free zone, then why don't teachers and school administrators insist that the cops leave all their guns outside the school? Obviously it's not really a gun-free zone, because when there's trouble, they want <b>men with guns to arrive as quickly as possible and bring their guns</b>.<br><br>There are all sorts of other problems with this plan, as pointed out by Eric Reed of <a></a><br><br><i>...this procedure raises many questions.

V(Natural News) The truth is finally coming to light about the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2018s (CDC) coverup of vaccine dangers, particularly those vaccines that include the mercury-based preservative Thimerosal. The incredible work of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and his colleague Lyn Redwood, R.N., M.S.N., has unveiled the fact that neither the CDC nor the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has ever calculated the cumulative infant exposure to mercury from routine childhood vaccines, and that this deliberate safety oversight has damaged potentially millions upon millions of innocent children.\u000a\u000aDocuments the duo uncovered show that both the FDA and the CDC knew that infant vaccines containing Thimerosal were collectively exposing children to levels of the neurotoxin that far exceeded federal safety guidelines, but that the two agencies covered for the vaccine industry by ignoring this fact. These documents, which were put together by a toxicology consultant who had worked for the FDA and noticed the discrepancies, illustrate once again how key government agencies have deferred to defending the interests of profitable industries over the health of Americans.\u000a\u000aIn accordance with the 1997 FDA Modernization Act, the American people via Congress ordered that the FDA compile a thorough list of all drugs that contain mercury compounds so that they could be assessed for safety by the FDA\u2019s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER). After this was completed, however, revealing far too much mercury in childhood vaccines, the FDA intentionally stalled in taking action to protect children.\u000a\u000aA thorough review put forth by Dr. Barry Rumack, M.D., of Rumack Consulting, clearly showed that routine childhood vaccines containing Thimerosal were exposing children to levels of mercury that could severely harm them. But the FDA chose to conceal this pertinent information in violation of its prescribed duties, and in direct betrayal of the children whose parents\u2019 taxpayer dollars continue to be spent on keeping failed regulatory agencies like the FDA in operation.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere was no point in time from birth to approximately 16-18 months of age that infants were below the EPA guidelines for allowable mercury exposure,\u201d the Eco Watch article by Kennedy and Redwood explains. \u201cIn fact, according to the models, blood and body burden levels of mercury peaked at six months of age at a shockingly high level of 120ng/liter [nanograms per liter]. To put this in perspective, the CDC classifies mercury poisoning as blood levels of mercury greater than 10 ng/L.\u201d\u000a\u000aPresident Trump brings in Robert Kennedy Jr. to head vaccine safety commission\u000a\u000aTo make matters worse, the FDA actually hired an unqualified pediatrician with very little knowledge of toxicology to cover for the agency\u2019s betrayal of the American people. When later asked about why she agreed to report mercury exposure levels in a deceptive fashion that fit the FDA\u2019s fake narrative that vaccines are safe for children, Dr. Leslie Ball responded that it was \u201cwhat I was told to do.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn other words, the FDA hired a hack to be its ministry of propaganda in order to reassure the American public that vaccines are safe \u2013 when they most certainly are not \u2013 and the agency has yet to be held accountable for this egregious offense against public safety.\u000a\u000aFortunately for Americans, Robert Kennedy Jr., who has worked tirelessly to expose the lies surrounding vaccines, was recently called upon by the Trump administration to head an investigative committee to reassess vaccine safety and come up with a more scientifically-sound and honest way of deciding how to proceed with this controversial medical intervention.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe CDC brainwashing of the global medical profession, international health agencies and the media regarding the deceitfulness of vaccine \u2018safety\u2019 is nothing short of criminal action, which must be addressed at every level: local school districts, state health agencies, national courts globally, and the World Health Organization, a \u2018mouthpiece\u2019 of CDC\u2019s deceitfulness and fraudulent research and health recommendations,\u201d says Catherine Frompovich, a vaccine safety advocate and researcher.\u000a\u000aSources for this article include:\u000a\u000aNaturalBlaze.com\u000a\u000aEcoWatch.com\u000a\u000aTrump.news\u000a\u000aCatherineJFrompovich.com

VAccording to Organdonor.gov, the first two recorded organ transplants in the U.S. used the skin in 1860 and the cornea in 1906. It wasn\u2019t until 1954 that doctor\u2019s performed the first kidney transplant, and to this day, the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN), reports the kidney as being the number one requested, sought and utilized transplant organ. The kidneys are blood-purifying organs, so be sure you assist your own kidneys with plenty of clean, pure water. The OPTN is an enormous depository of transplant data featuring active waiting lists, educational materials, best practices for hospitals and doctors, patient options and most of all, encouragement for donors, which include those living, and dead. Clarifying just who is \u201cdead\u2019 and what \u201cdead is\u201d has been long been a subject of discussion, but it is an especially critical concept in the transplant world.\u000a\u000aAs reported by Natural News, a 41-year-old woman named Colleen Burns was declared \u201cbrain dead\u201d by doctors at a Syracuse, New York hospital. After hearing this prognosis, her family gave permission for the doctors to begin transplant procedures. But Colleen wasn\u2019t dead. In fact, she opened her eyes to those bright lights in the operating theater, just as the physicians were getting ready for their harvest. St. Joseph\u2019s Hospital Health Center was fined a mere $6000 for this debacle according to Syracuse.com, because the doctors didn\u2019t do enough brain scans, nor test for drugs in Burn\u2019s system. And they paid no attention to \u201cnurse\u2019s observations indicating Burns was not dead and her condition was improving.\u201d Guess they were in a hurry, huh?\u000a\u000aBeing brain dead wasn\u2019t always the criteria used to describe an individual no longer considered alive.

VCastor oil is often overlooked for its benefits for the skin and hair because of its extremely thick and sticky consistency. However, if you\u2019re looking for a cheap, natural remedy for several common skin and hair complaints, then castor oil is definitely worth your time.\u000a\u000aCastor oil for regrowing and thickening hair, eyelashes and eyebrows\u000a\u000aI first stumbled on castor oil as a remedy for regrowing thin eyebrows. I had over-plucked my brows back in the nineties when it was the hip thing to have pencil thin brows, and they never did quite recover.

I bought a hexane free, organic and cold pressed castor oil and started applying it to my eyebrows every night after washing my face. After about three months, I noticed my brows were noticeably thicker (and they seemed to be growing in darker as well), and attributed it to the nightly application of castor oil.\u000a\u000aI\u2019m not the only one that this has worked for. So, why would castor oil help you regrow hair \u2013 both on your head and the other two important places, the eyebrows and the eyelashes.\u000a\u000aCastor oil is high in ricinoleic acid. This acid is a very effective natural anti-bacterial and anti-fungal agent. This can help keep any fungus or bacteria from inhibiting hair growth. Since the oil is also very thick, it may help to prevent hair loss simply by helping to coat the hair and protect it from falling out.\u000a\u000aCastor oil is also high in omega 9 fatty acids, which are nourishing to both the hair and the follicle, as well as the surrounding skin. Castor oil has a unique ability to be deeply penetrating, and this helps it to deliver its nourishment deeply into the pores and the follicles that produce hair.\u000a\u000aIt also has a high gloss, so it lends a lush glossiness and shine to the hair. A little goes a long way, and it is best to only add a tiny bit to the very ends of your hair instead of putting it up near the scalp if you\u2019re just looking for a natural hair smoother.\u000a\u000aSimply put about two drops on your hands and rub, then smooth through the ends. If you use too much, there is a fine line between subtle shine and a heavy greasiness so go very light until you figure out the amount that works right for your hair type.\u000a\u000aIf you\u2019re looking to regrow the hair on your head, you can use castor oil as a scalp treatment. However it can be tricky to get on the scalp without thinning it out with a lighter oil. You can add some melted coconut oil, apricot kernel oil or another lighter oil to help get it spreadable enough.\u000a\u000aIf you\u2019re simply looking to help thicken hair that is thinning at the edges of your hairline, you can use pure castor oil, with a light hand of course. Another use is to apply the oil to eyelashes to help thicken and strengthen them, as well as to help prevent thinning and shedding.\u000a\u000aCastor oil for scar tissue reduction and shiny, smooth lips\u000a\u000aMany attest to the wonders castor oil offers for keloid types of scars and other scars that involve a lot of hardened scar tissue. This is presumably due to its ability for deep penetration through multiple skin layers.\u000a\u000aBecause castor oil softens the skin so much, the thought is that this softening helps to break down deep scar tissue so it may be smoothed out. In addition, castor oil has shown promise as a white blood cell stimulating agent. Studies have also shown that castor bean oil helps reduce the inflammatory response in subcutaneous tissue. This may be why it seems to speed wound healing, and may also contribute to its ability to reduce scarring more quickly.\u000a\u000aCastor oil is also excellent for the lips. Our lips needs constant protection against the elements. Although our lips regenerate and recover quickly, they also dry out and begin to peel when they are dehydrated.\u000a\u000aCastor oil not only smooths the lips with fatty acids, but it also helps protect them due to its naturally thick and immovable nature.

V<div><p>Castor oil is often overlooked for its benefits for the skin and hair because of its extremely thick and sticky consistency.&#160; However, if you&#8217;re looking for a cheap, natural remedy for several common skin and hair complaints, then castor oil is definitely worth your time.</p>\u000a<h3><p>Castor oil for regrowing and thickening hair, eyelashes and eyebrows</p></h3>\u000a<p>I first stumbled on castor oil as a remedy for regrowing thin eyebrows.

VThe things that the perpetually angry Left choose to either protest or support leave rational people shaking their heads in confusion. And that\u2019s because liberalism is a mental disorder.\u000a\u000aIt would have to be, wouldn\u2019t it, to support what you would call \u201cfundamental human rights\u201d on the one hand, then protest actions aimed at protecting those fundamental rights on the other, correct?\u000a\u000aWhile governor of Indiana, Vice President Mike Pence signed a piece of legislation enshrining religious freedom into state law \u2013 something that should not have been necessary, given the Constitution\u2019s existing First Amendment religious protections. The angry Left protested the law, claiming that it somehow legalized discrimination against the LGTB community. (RELATED: Are you freedoms under assault? Find out at Liberty.news)\u000a\u000aThe law did nothing of the sort, and Pence even said so at the time. \u201cThis bill is not about discrimination, and if I thought it legalized discrimination I would have vetoed it.\u201d\u000a\u000aSo why did he sign it in the first place? Because Americans around the country actually had been discriminated against \u2013 due to their religious beliefs \u2013 and he wanted to provide Indianans with an extra state-level measure of protection. What\u2019s even more ironic and hypocritical is that liberals, who claim to corner the market on \u201ccompassion,\u201d \u201cinclusion\u201d and \u201ctolerance,\u201d were the ones persecuting people for practicing and observing their Christian faith.\u000a\u000aNow, more hypocrisy and irony.\u000a\u000aThe same groups of people who support the LGBT community and \u201cwomen\u2019s rights\u201d are currently protesting an executive order issued by President Donald J. Trump that temporarily bans people from seven countries known to harbor or foment terrorism from coming into the United States.\u000a\u000a\u201cThat\u2019s not fair!\u201d they shout. \u201cThat\u2019s not who we are!\u201d they bellow. \u201cRefugees and migrants have rights!\u201d they demand.\u000a\u000aYet, the people who are being defended by these angry, non-thinking liberals are adherents to a faith \u2013 Islam \u2013 that sanctions the persecution and killing of LGBT individuals and women.\u000a\u000aConsider:\u000a\u000a\u2014 There are a dozen countries whose Islamic-centric governments kill people just for being gay or lesbian, as reported by The Advocate, a magazine for the gay community: Iran, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Yemen, Nigeria, Somalia, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, Mauritania, the Islamic State (ISIS)-controlled territories in Syria and Iraq, and the United Arab Emirates.\u000a\u000a\u2014 Reliably Left-leaning Politifact, in attempting to denigrate one-time GOP presidential nominee and current Trump Housing and Urban Development secretary, Ben Carson, in September 2015, had to really split hairs in order to down-rate his comment that no Muslim nations have rights for women or gays or protect freedom of religion. The ones with the best records \u2013 and none of the Muslim-dominated governments have what a rational person would consider a good one \u2013 are still poor in each of these areas.\u000a\u000a\u2014 What\u2019s also true is that in countries dominated by large Muslim majorities, there is virtually no religious freedom whatsoever; you\u2019re either a Muslim or you\u2019re shunned and/or killed. By comparison, there are plenty of Arab Muslims in Israel, but no Jews in the Arab world.\u000a\u000aBut none of this matters to the perpetually angry Left protesting Trump\u2019s order; they see no hypocrisy, no irony and no problem at all advocating for the invasion of their country by people who don\u2019t share the same values as their own. (RELATED: Stay up-to-date on how President Trump is defending your rights at Freedom.news)\u000a\u000aFollowing Trump\u2019s victory in November, far-Left liberals who tried to paint him as a misogynistic woman-hater were upset at all the women who voted for him, claiming they were \u201cvoting against their own interests.\u201d\u000a\u000aIsn\u2019t that a bit like supporting people who legitimately repress women, kill gays and punish religious freedom?\u000a\u000aJ.D.

VInfluenza (flu) season is here. The media and CDC have been heavily pushing the influenza vaccine for over a month already. However, research has shown that this year\u2019s flu shot is extremely toxic, ineffective and unsafe! Did you know that the 2013-2014 influenza vaccines contain dangerous levels of mercury? The vaccine contains 25,000 times more mercury than the safety limit for drinking water! Did you know that infant and pediatric flu deaths were on the decline until 2003 when the pediatric influenza vaccine was introduced? After that, the pediatric death rate skyrocketed! Before you choose to vaccinate yourself and your children, get the facts about the influenza vaccine.\u000a\u000aI have recently written several articles on the problems and dangers of the flu shot. Read here about why the flu shot is more dangerous than the flu. You can also read here about how the media-reported flu deaths have been hyped up in order to scare people into the flu shot. Healthcare decisions, in general, can be complicated. The vaccine decision is even more complicated due to the vast amount of conflicting information. Before you make these decisions, I urge to move past the hype and get the facts!\u000a\u000aMost importantly, you must know that your body is intelligently designed to fight the hundreds of influenza viruses that cause the flu. Your immune system is amazingly well equipped to help you prevent colds, flu and even cancer. Developing a flu-proof immune system is an essential part of your health plan this year. You can stay well! Even if you do get sick, you can overcome the flu and heal.\u000a\u000aThis astounding report was written by Mary Tocco, independent vaccine investigator. She reveals the truth about this years influenza vaccines and the facts that the pharmaceutical industry and the CDC do not want you to know. This is information provides facts not hype. It is exactly what you need in order to confidently make your decision about the influenza vaccine.\u000a\u000aInfluenza Vaccine Facts They Don\u2019t Want You to Know!\u000a\u000aUpdated: September 5, 2013\u000a\u000aMary Tocco\u000a\u000aThe 2013-2014 Influenza vaccines have been approved for use and will contain Thimerosal (Hg, mercury) and are recommended for every child, adult and pregnant mother. Here are the 5 different influenza vaccines:\u000a\u000aTrivalent Vaccines Afluria® 5.0 mL multi-dose vial\u2014one 0.5mL jab will contain 24.5 \u03bcg Hg\u000a\u000aFluLaval® 5.0 mL multi-dose vial\u2014one 0.5 mL jab will contain less than 25\u03bcg Hg\u000a\u000aFluvirin® 0.5 mL one dose prefilled syringe will contain \u2264 1 \u03bcg Hg 5.0 mL multi-dose vial\u2014one 0.5 mL jab will contain 25 \u03bcg Hg\u000a\u000aFluzone® 5.0 mL multi-dose vial\u2014one 0.5 mL jab will contain 25 \u03bcg Hg\u000a\u000aFluLaval® Quadrivalent 5.0 mL multi-dose vial\u2014one jab will contain 25 \u03bcg Hg\u000a\u000aPlease keep in mind that one (1) microgram (\u03bcg) equals 0.0010 milligram (mg). Often physicians refer to the \u201ctrace\u201d of thimerosal as safe and even healthy! The way to compare what a trace is in a vaccine is to compare to what is considered safe and allowable in our environment: water, liquids and foods we eat and compare the levels in the vaccines they encourage us to inject.\u000a\u000a2 ppb (parts-per-billion) is the mandated safeyt limit in drinking water\u000a\u000a200 ppb of mercury in liquid waste renders it a toxic hazard and must be treated as such\u000a\u000a730-1400 ppb is EPA safe allowable limit in fish (we ingest)\u000a\u000a 25,000 ppb may be found in the infant flu vaccine (injected)\u000a\u000a50,000 ppb found in regular flu vaccine recommended for children, pregnant mothers and adults (injected)\u000a\u000aBoyd Haley, Professor and Chair, Dept. of Chemistry, University Kentucky and mercury specialist in 2001 was responding to the statement that the mercury in vaccines is safe and he said the following, \u201cA single vaccine given to a 6 pound newborn (containing thimerosal) is the equivalent of giving a 180-pound adult 30 vaccinations on the same day.\u201d\u000a\u000aFact #1: Over 200 viruses can cause influenza and influenza-like illness which produce the same or similar symptoms. Unless you have laboratory tests, doctors cannot tell the illnesses apart. All these related illnesses can last for days and rarely lead to death or serious illness unless a person is immune compromised. Vaccines usually contain only three (3) viruses that were chosen to be included in vaccines many months before a flu season begins, so it is a guessing game as to which flu strain will actually occur.\u000a\u000aFact #2: Currently, there are no studies tracking people who get the vaccine and get sick with flu symptoms or other reactions including death, which should be made for proper disease diagnosis, data collecting and controls. When reported to doctors, people are told that they can\u2019t catch the flu from the vaccine. I personally have had hundreds of people share their stories with me including stories about people who have died following the vaccine. Stories of paralysis, narcolepsy and febrile convulsions, neurological problems and pregnancy miscarriages are common. Nurses who work in the hospitals are witness to the numbers of people who come in to the emergency room very ill after the influenza vaccines.\u000a\u000aFact #3: Death rates from influenza are combined with people who are immune compromised and actually die with pneumonia, a complication of contracting influenza.\u000a\u000aFact #4: Prior to implementing the pediatric flu vaccine in 2003, pediatric deaths from influenza were decreasing. The CDC recommended universal influenza vaccines for children in 2003. According to the Center for Disease Vital Statistics and the MMWR Annual Report, deaths have increased, indicating flu vaccines are not as effective as advertised:\u000a\u000a1999 \u2013 25 deaths\u000a\u000a2000 \u2013 19 deaths\u000a\u000a2001 \u2013 13 deaths\u000a\u000a2002 \u2013 12 deaths\u000a\u000a2003 \u2013 90 deaths (Year of mass vaccinations of children under age 5 years)\u000a\u000a2006 \u2013 78 deaths\u000a\u000a2007 \u2013 88 deaths\u000a\u000a2008 \u2013 116 deaths (40.9% vaccinated at age 6 months to 23 months)\u000a\u000a2009 \u2013 276 deaths\u000a\u000a2010 \u2013 115 deaths\u000a\u000aNeil Z. Miller, Vaccine Safety Manual For Concerned Families and Health Practitioners (New Atlantean Press) pg. 97 (Years 199-2003) References: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report \u2013 CDC Sept. 16, 2011 \u201cCopyright Neil Z. Miller- Vaccine Safety Manual (New Atlantean Press)\u201d\u000a\u000aFact #5: Influenza death rates are greatly exaggerated at the beginning of each flu season to drive people to get the vaccines. The common figure of 35,000 deaths per year is not true and has not been the true number for many years. A more accurate figure is closer to 20, 000 deaths per year nationally from influenza, and majority of time it is people who are immune compromised with other chronic/acute illnesses. The main reason for death is pneumonia, not the flu but the statistics are blended together to make it appear worse than it is. In the book, Vaccine Safety Manual (pg. 97) by Neil Z. Miller, he carefully examined the true statistics published in the Mortality Morbidity Weekly Report and found the actual deaths from pediatric influenza as noted above years 1999-2003.\u000a\u000aFact #6: National Coalition of Organized Women studied the numbers of pregnancy miscarriages following the H1N1 2009-2010 influenza vaccine program and found a 20-plus-fold increase in miscarriages compared to the previous flu-vaccine-associated-miscarriages in 2007-2008 and 2008-2009 flu season. The H1N1 influenza vaccine contains thimerosal, a form of ethylmercury that was supposed to be removed from all vaccines after Congressional Hearings. (Government Reform Committee Hearings on Autism and Vaccines 2000-2003) Thimerosal is in all multi-dose vaccine vials.\u000a\u000aFact #7: When children die of influenza, they never look to see if that child was fully vaccinated (normal childhood vaccinations) previously resulting in immune suppression or compromise or if they had just received the influenza vaccine. The media uses a few unfortunate deaths to scare people into getting the flu vaccines. They also reference \u201cpandemic\u201d when in fact the numbers are low and do not qualify as a true pandemic, whose definition was changed by the World Health Organization (WHO in 2009).\u000a\u000aReference: http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/statements/2009/h1n1_pandemic_phase6_20090611/en/index.html\u000a\u000aThis was exactly what happened in the 2009-2010 world-wide influenza H1N1 season.\u000a\u000aFact #8: We were told the lie by the government that the H1N1 virus was a \u201cnever before seen virus\u201d in 2009-2010 fake pandemic year. Pharmaceutical companies have been producing influenza vaccines for many years and have been giving people the H1N1 virus since 2006-2007 in 2 vaccines:\u000a\u000a(1) Fluvirin® Purified Surface Antigen Vaccine, Trivalent, Types A and B Manufacturer Chiron Corp. Microorganism-Influenza virus H1N1, H3N2, B/Malaysia/2506/2004 strains Licensed 07/21/2006\u000a\u000a(2) FluMist® Live, intranasal influenza Manufacturer MedImmune, Wyeth Microorganism- H1N1, H3N2, B/Jilin/20/2003 (B/Shanghai/361/2002-13; like strains of Influenza virus Licensed 01/05/2007\u000a\u000aThis new virus was bioengineered in a lab as are all the influenza vaccines. They are combining viruses that would never show up in nature. This is what I refer to as \u201cFrankenScience\u201d and is extremely dangerous. By introducing these to the world, they are assuring some crazy outbreak eventually as people\u2019s immune systems malfunction.\u000a\u000aInfluenza: Evidence from Cochrane Reviews\u000a\u000aThe Cochrane Reviews have summarized data about the benefits and harms of several interventions for preventing and treating influenza. These comprehensive reviews provide valuable information for patients, doctors, and healthcare decision-makers. I encourage people to pull it off the Internet and read the entire review but here are some of the highlights of the report exposing the lack of safety and lack of effectiveness.\u000a\u000aViral epidemics or pandemics of acute respiratory infections like influenza or severe acute respiratory syndrome pose a world-wide threat. Antiviral drugs and vaccinations may be insufficient to prevent catastrophe. This review assesses the effectiveness of physical interventions, such as hand-washing or wearing masks, to interrupt or reduce the spread of respiratory viruses.\u000a\u000aPreventing influenza: drugs, including neuraminidase inhibitors (e.g. Relenza and Tamiflu) Amantadine and rimantadine for influenza A in children and the elderly. Although amantadine and rimantadine are used to relieve or treat influenza A symptoms in healthy adults, little is known about the effectiveness and safety of these antivirals in preventing and treating influenza A in children and the elderly.\u000a\u000aPreventing influenza: vaccines for healthy people: The consequences of influenza in children and adults are mainly absenteeism from school and work.\u000a\u000aWe included 75 studies with about 300,000 observations. We included 17 RCTs, 19 cohort studies and 11 case-control studies in the analysis of vaccine efficacy and effectiveness. Evidence from RCTs shows that six children under the age of six need to be vaccinated with live attenuated vaccine to prevent one case of influenza (infection and symptoms). We could find no usable data for those aged two years or younger.\u000a\u000aInactivated vaccines in children aged two years or younger are not significantly more efficacious than placebo. Twenty-eight children over the age of six need to be vaccinated to prevent one case of influenza (infection and symptoms). Eight need to be vaccinated to prevent one case of influenza-like-illness (ILI). We could find no evidence of effect on secondary cases, lower respiratory tract disease, drug prescriptions, otitis media and its consequences and socioeconomic impact.\u000a\u000aWe found weak single-study evidence of effect on school absenteeism by children and caring parents from work. Extensive evidence of reporting bias of safety outcomes from trials of live attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIVs) impeded meaningful analysis. One specific brand of monovalent pandemic vaccine is associated with cataplexy and narcolepsy in children and there is sparse evidence of serious harms (such as febrile convulsions) in specific situations.\u000a\u000aConclusions: Influenza vaccines are efficacious in preventing cases of influenza in children older than two years of age, but little evidence is available for children younger than two years of age. There was a difference between vaccine efficacy and effectiveness, partly due to differing datasets, settings and viral circulation patterns. No safety comparisons could be carried out, emphasizing the need for standardization of methods and presentation of vaccine safety data in future studies. In specific cases, influenza vaccines were associated with serious harms such as narcolepsy and febrile convulsions. It was surprising to find only one study of inactivated vaccine in children under two years, given current recommendations to vaccinate healthy children from six months of age in the USA, Canada, parts of Europe and Australia. If immunization in children is to be recommended as a public health policy, large-scale studies assessing important outcomes, and directly comparing vaccine types are urgently required.\u000a\u000aInfluenza Manufacturer\u2019s Package Inserts Admit the Following:\u000a\u000a\u201cThere are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response\u201d.\u000a\u000aAnimal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Fluzone or Fluzone High-Dose. It is also not known whether Fluzone or Fluzone High-Dose can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction (fertility) capacity.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is not known whether Fluzone or Fluzone Intradermal is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Fluzone or Fluzone Intradermal is administered to a nursing woman.\u000a\u000aAnimal reproduction studies have not been conducted with FluMist.\u000a\u000aIt is not known whether FluMist can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity.\u000a\u000aFlu Vaccine Ingredients may contain all or some of the following toxic vaccine additives (adjuvants) [CDC \u2013 Vaccine Excipient & Media Summary]:\u000a\u000aEgg protein \u2013 many are allergic to eggs\u000a\u000aFormaldehyde \u2013 Formalyn (formalin) is a 37 percent solution of gaseous formaldehyde which includes methanol.

V<div><p>Influenza (flu) season is here. The media and CDC have been heavily pushing the influenza vaccine for over a month already. However, research has shown that this year&#8217;s&#160;<a title="20 Reasons Why The Flu Shot Is More Dangerous Than The Flu" href="http://wellnessachiever.net/flu-shot-more-dangerous-than-flu/" target="_blank">flu shot</a>&#160;is extremely toxic, ineffective and unsafe! Did you know that the 2013-2014 influenza vaccines contain&#160;<strong>dangerous levels of mercury</strong>? The vaccine contains&#160;<strong>25,000</strong>&#160;times more mercury than the safety limit for drinking water! Did you know that infant and pediatric flu deaths were on the decline&#160;<strong>until</strong>&#160;2003 when the pediatric influenza vaccine was introduced? After that, the pediatric death rate skyrocketed! Before you choose to vaccinate yourself and your children, get the facts about the influenza vaccine.</p>\u000a<p>I have recently written several articles on the problems and dangers of the flu shot. Read here about why<a title="20 Reasons Why The Flu Shot Is More Dangerous Than The Flu" href="http://wellnessachiever.net/flu-shot-more-dangerous-than-flu/" target="_blank">&#160;the flu shot is more dangerous than the flu</a>.

Healthcare decisions, in general, can be complicated. The vaccine decision is even more complicated due to the vast amount of conflicting information. Before you make these decisions, I urge to move past the hype and get the facts!</p>\u000a<p>Most importantly, you must know that your body is intelligently designed to fight the hundreds of influenza viruses that cause the flu.

She reveals the truth about this years influenza vaccines and the facts that the pharmaceutical industry and the CDC do not want you to know. This is information provides facts not hype. It is exactly what you need in order to confidently make your decision about the influenza vaccine.</p>\u000a<h1>Influenza Vaccine Facts They Don&#8217;t Want You to Know!</h1>\u000a<p dir="ltr">Updated: &#160;September 5, 2013</p>\u000a<p dir="ltr">Mary Tocco</p>\u000a<p dir="ltr">The&#160;<strong>2013-2014</strong>&#160;Influenza vaccines have been approved for use and will contain Thimerosal (<strong>Hg, mercury</strong>) and are recommended for every child, adult and pregnant mother. Here are the 5 different influenza vaccines:</p>\u000a<ul>\u000a<li>\u000a<p dir="ltr">Trivalent Vaccines Afluria&#174; 5.0 mL multi-dose vial&#8212;one 0.5mL jab will contain <strong>24.5 &#956;g Hg</strong></p>\u000a</li>\u000a<li>\u000a<p dir="ltr">FluLaval&#174; 5.0 mL multi-dose vial&#8212;one 0.5 mL jab will contain less than <strong>25&#956;g Hg</strong></p>\u000a</li>\u000a<li>\u000a<p dir="ltr">Fluvirin&#174; 0.5 mL one dose prefilled syringe will contain &#8804; 1 &#956;g Hg 5.0 mL multi-dose vial&#8212;one 0.5 mL jab will contain <strong>25 &#956;g Hg</strong></p>\u000a</li>\u000a<li>\u000a<p dir="ltr">Fluzone&#174; 5.0 mL multi-dose vial&#8212;one 0.5 mL jab will contain <strong>25 &#956;g Hg</strong></p>\u000a</li>\u000a<li>\u000a<p dir="ltr">FluLaval&#174; Quadrivalent 5.0 mL multi-dose vial&#8212;one jab will contain <strong>25 &#956;g Hg</strong></p>\u000a</li>\u000a</ul>\u000a<p dir="ltr">Please keep in mind that one (1) microgram (&#956;g) equals 0.0010 milligram (mg). Often physicians refer to the &#8220;trace&#8221; of thimerosal as safe and even healthy! The way to compare what a trace is in a vaccine is to compare to what is considered safe and allowable in our environment: water, liquids and foods we eat and compare the levels in the vaccines they encourage us to inject.</p>\u000a<ul>\u000a<li>\u000a<p dir="ltr">2 ppb (parts-per-billion) is the mandated safeyt limit in drinking water</p>\u000a</li>\u000a<li>\u000a<p dir="ltr">200 &#160;ppb of mercury in liquid waste renders it a toxic hazard and must be treated as such</p>\u000a</li>\u000a<li>\u000a<p dir="ltr">&#151;730-1400 ppb is EPA safe allowable limit in fish (we ingest)</p>\u000a</li>\u000a<li>\u000a<p dir="ltr">&#151;<strong>25,000</strong>&#160;ppb may be found in the infant flu vaccine (injected)</p>\u000a</li>\u000a<li>\u000a<p dir="ltr"><strong>50,000</strong>&#160;ppb found in regular flu vaccine recommended for children, pregnant mothers and adults (injected)</p>\u000a</li>\u000a</ul>\u000a<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.chem.uky.edu/research/haley/" target="_blank">Boyd Haley</a>, Professor and Chair, Dept. of Chemistry, University Kentucky and&#160;<a href="http://www.mercuryexposure.info/home/about/itemlist/user/182-boydhaley" target="_blank">mercury specialist</a>&#160;in 2001 was responding to the statement that the mercury in vaccines is safe and he said the following, &#8220;A single vaccine given to a 6 pound newborn (containing thimerosal) is the equivalent of giving a 180-pound adult 30 vaccinations on the same day.&#8221;</p>\u000a<p dir="ltr"><strong>Fact #1:</strong>&#160;Over&#160;<strong>200</strong>&#160;viruses can cause influenza and influenza-like illness which produce the same or similar symptoms. Unless you have laboratory tests, doctors cannot tell the illnesses apart. All these related illnesses can last for days and rarely lead to death or serious illness unless a person is immune compromised. Vaccines usually contain<strong>&#160;only three (3)</strong>&#160;viruses that were chosen to be included in vaccines many months before a flu season begins, so it is a guessing game as to which flu strain will actually occur.</p>\u000a<p dir="ltr"><strong>Fact #2:</strong>&#160;Currently, there are no studies tracking people who get the vaccine and get sick with flu symptoms or other reactions including death, which should be made for proper disease diagnosis, data collecting and controls. When reported to doctors, people are told that they can&#8217;t catch the flu from the vaccine. I personally have had hundreds of people share their stories with me including stories about people who have died following the vaccine. Stories of paralysis, narcolepsy and febrile convulsions, neurological problems and pregnancy miscarriages are common. Nurses who work in the hospitals are witness to the numbers of people who come in to the emergency room very ill after the influenza vaccines.</p>\u000a<p dir="ltr"><strong>Fact #3:</strong>&#160;Death rates from influenza are combined with people who are immune compromised and actually die with pneumonia, a complication of contracting influenza.</p>\u000a<p dir="ltr"><strong>Fact #4:</strong>&#160;Prior to implementing the pediatric flu vaccine in 2003, pediatric deaths from influenza were decreasing. The CDC recommended universal influenza vaccines for children in 2003. According to the Center for Disease Vital Statistics and the MMWR Annual Report, deaths have increased, indicating flu vaccines are not as effective as advertised:</p>\u000a<ul>\u000a<li>\u000a<p dir="ltr">1999 &#8211; &#160;25 deaths</p>\u000a</li>\u000a<li>\u000a<p dir="ltr">2000 &#8211; &#160;19 deaths</p>\u000a</li>\u000a<li>\u000a<p dir="ltr">2001 &#8211; &#160;13 deaths</p>\u000a</li>\u000a<li>\u000a<p dir="ltr">2002 &#8211; &#160;12 deaths</p>\u000a</li>\u000a<li>\u000a<p dir="ltr">2003 &#8211; &#160;90 deaths (Year of mass vaccinations of children under age 5 years)</p>\u000a</li>\u000a<li>\u000a<p dir="ltr">2006 &#8211; &#160;78 deaths</p>\u000a</li>\u000a<li>\u000a<p dir="ltr">2007 &#8211; &#160;88 deaths</p>\u000a</li>\u000a<li>\u000a<p dir="ltr">2008 &#8211; 116 deaths (40.9% vaccinated at age 6 months to 23 months)</p>\u000a</li>\u000a<li>\u000a<p dir="ltr">2009 &#8211; 276 deaths</p>\u000a</li>\u000a<li>\u000a<p dir="ltr">2010 &#8211; 115 deaths</p>\u000a</li>\u000a</ul>\u000a<p dir="ltr">Neil Z.

The common figure of 35,000 deaths per year is not true and has not been the true number for many years. A more accurate figure is closer to 20, 000 deaths per year nationally from influenza, and majority of time it is people who are immune compromised with other chronic/acute illnesses. The main reason for death is pneumonia, not the flu but the statistics are blended together to make it appear worse than it is.

Miller</a>, he carefully examined the true statistics published in the Mortality Morbidity Weekly Report and found the actual deaths from pediatric influenza as noted above years 1999-2003.</p>\u000a<p dir="ltr"><strong>Fact #6:</strong>&#160;National Coalition of Organized Women studied the numbers of pregnancy miscarriages following the H1N1 2009-2010 influenza vaccine program and found a 20-plus-fold increase in miscarriages compared to the previous flu-vaccine-associated-miscarriages in 2007-2008 and 2008-2009 flu season. The H1N1 influenza vaccine contains thimerosal, a form of ethylmercury that was supposed to be removed from all vaccines after Congressional Hearings.

The media uses a few unfortunate deaths to scare people into getting the flu vaccines. They also reference &#8220;pandemic&#8221; when in fact the numbers are low and do not qualify as a true pandemic, whose definition was changed by the World Health Organization (<a href="http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/89/7/11-086173/en/" target="_blank">WHO in 2009</a>).</p>\u000a<p dir="ltr">Reference:&#160;<a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/statements/2009/h1n1_pandemic_phase6_20090611/en/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/statements/2009/h1n1_pandemic_phase6_20090611/en/index.html</a></p>\u000a<p dir="ltr">This was exactly what happened in the 2009-2010 world-wide influenza H1N1 season.</p>\u000a<p dir="ltr"><strong>Fact #8:</strong>&#160;We were told the lie by the government that the H1N1 virus was a &#8220;never before seen virus&#8221; in 2009-2010 fake pandemic year.

These comprehensive reviews provide valuable information for patients, doctors, and healthcare decision-makers. I encourage people to pull it off the Internet and read the entire review but here are some of the highlights of the report exposing the lack of safety and lack of effectiveness.</p>\u000a<ul>\u000a<li>\u000a<p dir="ltr">Viral epidemics or pandemics of acute respiratory infections like influenza or severe acute respiratory syndrome pose a world-wide threat. Antiviral drugs and vaccinations may be insufficient to prevent catastrophe. This review assesses the effectiveness of physical interventions, such as hand-washing or wearing masks, to interrupt or reduce the spread of respiratory viruses.</p>\u000a</li>\u000a</ul>\u000a<ul>\u000a<li>\u000a<p dir="ltr">Preventing influenza: drugs, including neuraminidase inhibitors (e.g. Relenza and Tamiflu) Amantadine and rimantadine for influenza A in children and the elderly. Although amantadine and rimantadine are used to relieve or treat influenza A symptoms in healthy adults, little is known about the effectiveness and safety of these antivirals in preventing and treating influenza A in children and the elderly.</p>\u000a</li>\u000a</ul>\u000a<ul>\u000a<li>\u000a<p dir="ltr">Preventing influenza: vaccines for healthy people: The consequences of influenza in children and adults are mainly absenteeism from school and work.</p>\u000a</li>\u000a</ul>\u000a<ul>\u000a<li>\u000a<p dir="ltr">We included 75 studies with about 300,000 observations. We included 17 RCTs, 19 cohort studies and 11 case-control studies in the analysis of vaccine efficacy and effectiveness. Evidence from RCTs shows that six children under the age of six need to be vaccinated with live attenuated vaccine to prevent one case of influenza (infection and symptoms). We could find no usable data for those aged two years or younger.</p>\u000a</li>\u000a</ul>\u000a<ul>\u000a<li>\u000a<p dir="ltr">Inactivated vaccines in children aged two years or younger are not significantly more efficacious than placebo. Twenty-eight children over the age of six need to be vaccinated to prevent one case of influenza (infection and symptoms). Eight need to be vaccinated to prevent one case of influenza-like-illness (ILI). We could find no evidence of effect on secondary cases, lower respiratory tract disease, drug prescriptions, otitis media and its consequences and socioeconomic impact.</p>\u000a</li>\u000a</ul>\u000a<ul>\u000a<li>\u000a<p dir="ltr">We found weak single-study evidence of effect on school absenteeism by children and caring parents from work. Extensive evidence of reporting bias of safety outcomes from trials of live attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIVs) impeded meaningful analysis. One specific brand of monovalent pandemic vaccine is associated with cataplexy and narcolepsy in children and there is sparse evidence of serious harms (such as febrile convulsions) in specific situations.</p>\u000a</li>\u000a</ul>\u000a<ul>\u000a<li>\u000a<p dir="ltr">Conclusions: Influenza vaccines are efficacious in preventing cases of influenza in children older than two years of age, but little evidence is available for children younger than two years of age. There was a difference between vaccine efficacy and effectiveness, partly due to differing datasets, settings and viral circulation patterns. No safety comparisons could be carried out, emphasizing the need for standardization of methods and presentation of vaccine safety data in future studies. In specific cases, influenza vaccines were associated with serious harms such as narcolepsy and febrile convulsions. It was surprising to find only one study of inactivated vaccine in children under two years, given current recommendations to vaccinate healthy children from six months of age in the USA, Canada, parts of Europe and Australia. If immunization in children is to be recommended as a public health policy, large-scale studies assessing important outcomes, and directly comparing vaccine types are urgently required.</p>\u000a</li>\u000a</ul>\u000a<h2>Influenza Manufacturer&#8217;s Package Inserts Admit the Following:</h2>\u000a<ul>\u000a<li>\u000a<p dir="ltr">&#8220;There are, however,&#160;<strong>no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women</strong>.

V(Natural News) The system. The machine. The man. The powers that be. Whatever you choose to call the hidden power structure that pulls many of the strings in our country and world, its function is still the same: to enslave the people of our planet with agenda-driven propaganda, fake fiat currencies, endless war, toxins and disease, chemical medicine and biotechnology, and various other mechanisms of nefarious control that, for all intents and purposes, ultimately lead to misery and death.\u000a\u000aBut who or what are the entities behind all this destruction, and is there anything we can do to stop them? Exposing them is the first step. The following 10 institutions represent some of the most influential players in the compartmentalized system of warfare that continues to be waged against free humanity:\u000a\u000a1) Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)\u000a\u000aThis global research university is a product of the infamous industrialist and steel magnate Andrew Carnegie, whose legacy is marked by American subversion and globalism. C.M.U. churns out human assets to benefit not only the United States war machine, but also its various illegal spying and subversion apparatuses such as the National Security Agency (N.S.A.), which operates in violation of the U.S. Constitution.\u000a\u000aIt is common for C.M.U. to receive large grants from private entities to produce various technologies for the military-industrial complex, which is responsible for spreading chaos, destruction, and death throughout the world.\u000a\u000a2) Georgia Institute of Technology (GIT)\u000a\u000aThis technical college works closely with the military\u2019s \u201cmad science\u201d division known as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (D.A.R.P.A.), which is essentially what produces war technology for the Pentagon. D.A.R.P.A. is responsible for developing \u201cbig data\u201d entities like the N.S.A., as well as other advanced technologies for use in war. G.I.T. is also closely intertwined with defense contractor Northrop Grumman.\u000a\u000a3) Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)\u000a\u000aM.I.T. is widely recognized as one of the world\u2019s most reputable technical schools, but the institute is said to be where evil technologies such as weather manipulation and \u201cchemtrails\u201d were first developed. So-called geoengineering and its ties to M.I.T. Are well-documented in such works as Peter Kirby\u2019s Chemtrails Exposed: A New Manhattan Project.\u000a\u000a4) Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI)\u000a\u000aWhen it comes to the reengineering of food, W.P.I. has played an integral role in the development of gene-modification techniques and biotechnology that have changed the nature of the foods we eat. W.P.I. is heavily entrenched in the pro-GMO narrative, claiming that genetically-modified organisms are completely safe and pose no risks to human health or the environment.\u000a\u000a5) Michigan State University (MSU)\u000a\u000aAnother GMO cheerleader is M.S.U., which was exposed for accepting a government grant to develop a transgenic potato for use in Bangladesh and India. Both of these countries, and the latter in particular, have been devastated by the GMO invasion. Tens of thousands of Indian farmers have committed suicide because of failed biotechnology tools that were forced upon them by greedy multinationals like Monsanto.\u000a\u000a6) Purdue University\u000a\u000aA major player in pharmaceuticals and biotechnology, Purdue University actually claims that GMOs help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, even when the chemicals used to grow them have been shown to absolutely devastate the environment, including soils that, in an otherwise healthy state, are meant to capture carbon dioxide (CO2) and sequester to prevent so-called \u201cglobal warming.\u201d\u000a\u000a7) The Modern War Institute.\u000a\u000aAs its name suggests, this think tank organization self-identifies as \u201ca national resource within the Dept. of Military Instruction that studies recent and on-going conflicts.\u201d Part of the United States Military Academy at West Point (U.S.M.A.), the Modern War Institute functions similarly to the Council on Foreign Relations (C.F.R.), a known globalist group that pushes war to advance certain agendas, particularly in the Middle East.\u000a\u000a8) Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (at Harvard University)\u000a\u000aThis school is another geoengineering cheerleader that works closely with the U.S. government to develop technologies that it says are meant to block out the sun and prevent climate change. In truth, what this institution is doing is developing advanced methods of producting \u201cchemtrails\u201d that are harming people and the planet.\u000a\u000a9) Virginia Polytechnic Institute (Virginia Tech)\u000a\u000aThis hotbed of government and military activity is another D.A.R.P.A. ally that develops robots for the military-industrial complex, including so-called \u201chumanoid\u201d robots that are the type of thing one might imagine would possess enough artificial intelligence to take on humanity and possibly destroy it.\u000a\u000a10) Israel Institute of Technology (Technion)\u000a\u000aThis institutional arm of Big Pharma and Big Biotech has been a major catalyst in the conversion of our natural world into a synthetic one. Its first president, Alfred Mond, was a Jewish industrialist and active Zionist who steered the school\u2019s research focus towards chemicals and synthetics. Technion was founded at a time before the westernmost segment of the formerly Ottoman Palestine became what we now know as modern-day Israel.\u000a\u000aSources for this article include:\u000a\u000aTheMindUnleashed.com\u000a\u000aGlobalResearch.ca\u000a\u000aNPR.org\u000a\u000aTomDispatch.com

V(Natural News) When it comes to accurately and honestly reporting the news, there is a definitive limit to what reporters are allowed to cover, especially when they are fully immersed in the culture of what has come to be known as the \u201cmainstream media.\u201d There are certain topics that you just do not touch in this realm \u2014 unless, of course, you want to be fired or relegated to \u201cfringe\u201d status, which many of the best reporters over the years have sadly come to realize firsthand.\u000a\u000aThe hijacking of news by special interests \u2014 and especially medical news \u2014 is hardly new. But the great disservice that it has done to the people of not only the United States but everywhere else that censorship has prevailed, is largely underestimated. For probably the last 100 years, medicine and the advancements surrounding it have served a sinister agenda that, far from helping people achieve true health, has harmed and killed millions upon millions of people through the printing of \u201cfake science\u201d medical news.\u000a\u000aWhen powerful interests began to invade medical schools and change their curricula right around the turn of the 20th century is when things really went south. Doctors began to treat symptoms rather than copiously search for the root causes of illness in order to facilitate their proper healing. Medicine switched from a system that embraced comprehensive immune support to one where pharmaceutical drugs became the answer to everything \u2014 much to detriment of public health.\u000a\u000aVaccines and pharmaceuticals have replaced sound nutrition and common sense sanitation and hygiene. The average person knows next to nothing about which foods and herbs might naturally help him or her avoid disease but likely knows that popping an aspirin will relieve that nagging headache. And perhaps the biggest culprit driving this mass ignorance is the media, which has been complicit in hiding the truth from people for many decades.\u000a\u000aWorse than terrorism: American medicine kills at least 225,000 people annually\u000a\u000aInvestigative journalist Jon Rappoport is all-too-familiar with media censorship, having withdrawn from its clutches back in the 1980s when he first observed what was going on. In the arena of vaccines, for instance, Rappoport recognized that stimulating the immune system to produce antibodies is not a reliable indicator that someone is immune from a disease, as antibodies also show up when a person is diagnosed with a disease \u2014 how reliable is that?\u000a\u000aOr, what about our system of medicine as a whole, which a prominent science paper published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) back in 2000 revealed is responsible for killing at least 225,000 people living in the U.S. every single year? Mainstream medicine is so harmful, in fact, that statistics now show it to be the third leading cause of death in the U.S., behind heart disease and cancer. (Learn more truths about modern medicine at Medicine.news.)\u000a\u000aIt is a matter of fact that 2.1 million people in the U.S. are hospitalized every single year due to reactions or side effects from medications that have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. In total, 36 million Americans suffer adverse reactions to FDA-approved drugs every year, and yet you will rarely hear a peep from the media about this serious epidemic.\u000a\u000aEverything from the way certain diseases are diagnosed to the way they are treated is a byproduct of a failed system that, thanks in large part to cowardly journalists who refuse to take a stand, is only continuing to consolidate power and bring more death and destruction to our planet.\u000a\u000aRappoport is smart: he got out while he could and has since made a name for himself as a brave, truth-telling journalist with high rapport in truth-telling circles. But many others outside the fold \u2014 some of whom know the truth but refuse to tell it for whatever reason \u2014 continue to tow the line, at the expense of untold millions of lives.\u000a\u000aSources:\u000a\u000aWakingTimes.com\u000a\u000aJHSPH.edu

VThe Mediterranean diet represents the traditional foods that people used to eat in countries like Italy and Greece in the late 1950s and early 1960s.\u000a\u000aStudies have shown that the diet can be beneficial to cause weight loss and help prevent heart attacks, strokes, type 2 diabetes and premature death.\u000a\u000aThis article will discuss 11 amazing ingredients in the Mediterranean diet by focusing more on the traditional diet eaten during that period.\u000a\u000aOlive Oil\u000a\u000aOlive oil dominates the varying dietary patterns that make up the overall Mediterranean diet. Olive oil, especially extra-virgin, is rich in tocopherols, carotenoids, and polyphenols, all of which provide it antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.\u000a\u000aOne of the polyphenols, a major antioxidant known as hydroxytyrosol, has been shown by a study that it may prevent cancers by inducing apoptosis (programmed cell death) in cancer cells and inhibit cancer cell-division cycles. Oleuropein is another antioxidant/anti-inflammatory polyphenol that has been studied extensively.\u000a\u000aOlive oil is the principal source of dietary fat, used for cooking and baking. Contrary to popular beliefs, high-quality extra-virgin olive oil has a high smoke point up to 410 degree Fahrenheit due to lower free fatty acid contents. Polyphenols in olive oil are said to act as natural preservatives that protect it from heat degradation.\u000a\u000aOlive\u000a\u000aOlive fruits, commonly known as olives, are universally eaten whole, and widely used for cooking and flavoring. The fruits, which the oil is derived from, are rich sources of fiber, carotenoids, and polyphenols. The last two phytochemicals exert anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.\u000a\u000aWheat\u000a\u000aWheat is the main grain eaten as a staple in the Mediterranean. Farro or emmer, an ancient wheat, is likely to be found accompanying dishes in many Mediterranean restaurants. Durum is another wheat variety famously used in an unrefined form in making pasta and bread. Its yellow color is due to beta carotene. Both farro/emmer wheat and durum offer high fiber, vitamin Bs, and antioxidant contents. They are good sources of proteins and mineral, including magnesium, zinc, and iron.\u000a\u000aWine\u000a\u000aAntonia Trichopoulou, in a review article, states that alcohol consumption was common in the traditional Mediterranean diet, but generally in moderation and in the form of wine and, as a rule, during meals.\u000a\u000aNOTE: Consider the following advice by Harvard School of Public Health on alcohol consumption,\u000a\u000a\u2018Moderate drinking can be healthy\u2014but not for everyone. You must weigh the benefits and risks; For most moderate drinkers, alcohol has overall health benefits especially for middle-aged individuals; Non-drinkers, shouldn\u2019t feel the need to start drinking to improve their health; Heavy drinkers, with their increased risk of cancer, heart disease, high blood pressure, cirrhosis, and dependence should cut back or stop drinking altogether.\u2019\u000a\u000aWild Greens\u000a\u000aGreens are used to make tortes/tortas and savory pies, a staple dish, in Southern France, Italy, and Greece as well as other countries of the Mediterranean. On the Greek island of Ikaria alone there are more than 150 types of wild greens, some of which includes fennel, dandelion greens, rocket (arugula), cardoon, purslane, and chicory.\u000a\u000aDark leafy greens are rich in carotenoids, bioflavonoids, vitamins C and E, and minerals such as magnesium, calcium, and iron. Their nutritional composition may vary between species, varieties, and cultivars.\u000a\u000aIn North America, available edible wild greens include chicory, chickweed, dandelion greens, milk thistle, watercress, and purslane, among others.\u000a\u000aConsuming a varied intake from different species over time is a great way to get an array of other nutrients and phytonutrients.\u000a\u000aCapers\u000a\u000aCapers, the unripened flower buds of Capparis spinosa var. dermis, prickly, perennial plants native to the Mediterranean and some parts of Asia, are generally used as a flavorful seasoning or garnish, and are an important ingredient in tapenade. Their use, mentioned as food in the Sumerian epic of Gilgamesh, dates back to more than 2000 B.C.\u000a\u000aAntioxidant-rich capers have long been a favorite in the Mediterranean region. They impart a piquant sour and salty flavor to salads, sauces, dressings, vegetables and a variety of main dishes. Capers\u2019s pungency and sharp flavor made it particularly common in Sicilian cooking and used in the Milanese sauce with anchovies.\u000a\u000aStudies have exhibited that capers may have strong antioxidant activity and contained high levels of antioxidant compounds. A study has shown capers to contain several types of polyphenols which may be responsible for their antioxidant properties. The same study also found capers to contain high zinc and iron levels.\u000a\u000aThe authors conclude that capers appear to be a good source of antioxidants and minerals that might serve to protect the health and combat several diseases.\u000a\u000aChickpeas (Garbanzos)\u000a\u000aChickpeas, one of the earliest known cultivated legumes, are the key ingredient in hummus, a famous creamy sauce. The soup consists of black and regular chickpeas, lentils, fava beans, and whole wheat is an important traditional dish in Puglia, Italy.\u000a\u000aChickpea flour is traditionally used to make a pancake or crêpe in Italy and France.\u000a\u000aChickpeas high proteins (15% Daily Value (DV)) and fiber contents (25% DV) help increase satiety. Glycemic index of chickpeas is 28, which falls into the range for low-glycemic index foods. They are good sources of iron, phosphorus, zinc, magnesium, potassium, thiamine, folate, riboflavin and vitamin B-6.\u000a\u000aLemons\u000a\u000aLemons and oranges originate from the Far East, and Arabs brought them to the Mediterranean. A typical habit in the Mediterranean is to squeeze lemons on salads, soups, beans, fish, and into drinking water, which help lower the glycemic load of the entire meal.\u000a\u000aThe acidity and high flavonoid content of lemon peels found to be a mechanism of lemon beneficial impact on blood glucose that can help control or prevent diabetes.\u000a\u000aLemon bioflavonoids, limonoids, coumarins, vitamin C and citric acid contents exert antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.\u000a\u000aGarlic\u000a\u000aGarlic is an essential ingredient in many Mediterranean cuisines and it varies in it uses from province to province. Garlic contains approximately 33 sulfur compounds responsible for its pungent odor and most of its health benefits, which include anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant effects.\u000a\u000aHerbs\u000a\u000aHerbs and spices are widely used in the Mediterranean cuisine. Herbs are sources of high antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compounds, especially polyphenols. They have been found to contribute significant flavonols and flavones in levels via overall dietary intake of the traditional Greek cuisine.\u000a\u000aFeta and Yogurt\u000a\u000aTraditional feta is a white salty Greek cheese made from the milk of ewes or goats. The Turks are believed to have first introduced yogurt, which was more commonly used in the old Ottoman Empire (eastern Mediterranean).\u000a\u000aBoth feta and yogurt are fermented, provides additional proteins, make them good additions to the Mediterranean diet that\u2019s largely plant-based.\u000a\u000aStudies have shown probiotics play significant roles in not only taking care of your gut microbiota diversity but also have a positive influence on the immune system and the brain.\u000a\u000aTake Home Message\u000a\u000aThe Mediterranean diet offers a flavorful template of healthful plant-based meals to your daily diet. If you\u2019re not local to the Mediterranean you could try to adjust your diets to the principles of the traditional Mediterranean diet.\u000a\u000aAs for the types and nutritional values of foods are concerned, you can always acquire new and dynamic knowledge readily available 24/7 by reading great articles on the net written by dietetics or nutrition experts.

V(Natural News) Do you have too much lead in your blood? If you live and work in California, that may just be the case. Over 6,000 Californian workers from the manufacturing and construction industries have alarmingly high levels of lead in their blood. A new report from the state\u2019s public health agency has even indicated that the amount of lead in their blood is enough to cause serious health issues.\u000a\u000aElevated blood lead content is defined as at or above 5 micrograms per deciliter, according to state and national public health officials. California public health authorities say that persistent exposure to lead at these levels increases the risk of \u201chypertension, kidney disease, cognitive dysfunction, and adverse reproductive outcomes,\u201d in both adults and children. And according to the CDC, even slight elevations of blood lead levels can stunt development and reduce IQ.\u000a\u000aThe report, which contains results from testing conducted between 2012 and 2014, found that of the 38,440 workers tested, 6,051 had blood lead levels at or above 5 micrograms per deciliter. Most of the workers were men between the ages of 20 and 59 and lived in Southern California.\u000a\u000aBarbara Feder Ostrov of California Healthline reports that a staggering sixty percent of the workers with higher exposure levels \u2014 at or above 10 micrograms per deciliter \u2014 worked in manufacturing, often for companies that make aircraft and aircraft parts, ships, plumbing and pipefitting fixtures, metal valves, and also companies that make or recycle batteries.\u000a\u000aThose workers with the highest lead exposure \u2014 40 micrograms per deciliter or more \u2014 often worked in some form of the munitions industry, but some also worked in paints, construction, or another aspect of the metals industry.\u000a\u000aAccording to California Healthline, a spokesman for the California Manufacturers and Technology Association stated that the group \u201cdid not have a position on workplace lead exposure.\u201d The state of California only requires employers to test employees for lead if their work uses or \u201cdisturbs\u201d lead. However, state researchers have warned that many workers that are exposed to lead continue to go untested.\u000a\u000aThe report\u2019s authors also noted that current standards for lead adopted by the California\u2019s Division of Occupational Safety and Health (Cal/OSHA) are based on medical and scientific information that is now about 35 years old. \u201cOut-dated\u201d would be putting it mildly. The researchers recommend that Cal/OSHA make revisions and update its current standards to better protect the state\u2019s workers.\u000a\u000aChildren are being affected by lead, too\u000a\u000aCalifornia researchers have also collected data on children who have been exposed to lead as well. Children with a blood lead level of 4.5 micrograms or greater are considered to have an elevated blood lead level.\u000a\u000aThe Fruitvale district of Oakland was found to have the highest number of children under the age of six that were being overexposed to lead, according to testing data from 2012. Overexposure to lead was seen in 7.57 percent of kids under the age of six in that area, but other districts didn\u2019t fare much better. Shockingly high percentages of children with elevated blood lead content were seen around Bay Area cities.\u000a\u000aIn Seaside in Monterey County, 7.44 percent of young children had elevated blood lead levels, and in San Francisco\u2019s Mission District, 4.44 percent were also overexposed.\u000a\u000aFor perspective, only 5 percent of children tested in Flint, Michigan had elevated blood lead levels \u2014 and that was after they were exposed to lead in their drinking water, but before the water advisory was issued in 2015.\u000a\u000aIn other words, children in certain parts of California are being exposed to more lead than the children in Flint who were drinking contaminated water.\u000a\u000aIt is well known that lead is toxic in even very small amounts \u2014 California\u2019s failure to better regulate the industry is disgraceful. The CDC itself has stated that children of lead-exposed workers, in particular, are often at a higher risk of having elevated blood lead levels.\u000a\u000aStay informed about heavy metals poisoning at Metals.news.\u000a\u000aSources:\u000a\u000aDailyNews.com\u000a\u000aSanFrancisco.CBSLocal.com\u000a\u000aCDC.gov

The sixth leading cause of death in the world, Alzheimer's is most often the culprit behind the development of symptoms associated with dementia , such as memory loss, confusion, and the inability to recognize people and places once known by heart.Affecting nearly 35 million people per year, Alzheimer's normally costs families caring for a loved one with late-stage dementia roughly $300,000.While Alzheimer's is, for the most part, an atrociously awful degenerative process, there are ways to prevent and reverse symptoms associated with Alzheimer's and dementia. Events like the Alzheimer's and Dementia Summit being held from July 25 \u2013 August 1 are great examples of communally informative ways to gain a greater insight on how to find natural ways to slow down and even halt the onset of Alzheimer's.Featured speaker, Christopher Shade , PhD, will be offering insightful advice on the relation between heavy metal toxicity and the development of Alzheimer's. "I was just shocked what the overlap is between mercury neurotoxicity and Alzheimer's ," Shade wrote in a recently published article.Events like Shade's "Brain Defense \u2013 What to do About Heavy Metal Toxicity" can help shed a slight shade of light on Alzheimer's and all of the suffering that goes along with it.While most people will only be able to find hope in events like the Alzheimer's and Dementia Summit, there are a few cases that have found ways to be blissfully hopeful all on their own.Take for example, ME, a 101 year-old woman diagnosed with Alzheimer's when she was in her eighties, who has somehow managed to retain the ability to play the piano just as eloquently as she could when she was in her twenties.Preferring to go by ME for the preservation of her privacy, the 101 year-old miracle woman is rarely aware of her surroundings, often confused, and cannot recognize anyone she has met in the last few decades.When she hops on the piano though, a different story unfolds. Performing regularly at an assortment of California assisted living facilities, ME can play over 400 songs by ear from a variety of genres, including ragtime, show tunes, pop, and gospel."Her sense of memory and the richness of her harmonic arrangements is really very impressive," wrote Eleanor Selfridge-Field, a music and symbols researcher at Stanford University.Born in Tennessee in 1914, ME first learned to play the piano and violin as a child.

According to New Scientist, "[E]vidence suggests that music is more diffusely located in the brain than language networks," perhaps a possible reason for its ability to sustain itself in the memory of dementia patients.Heart-warming stories like ME's provide hope for research dedicated to finding cures for the debilitating effects of Alzheimer's disease.

VMedicare pays for more than 200 million doctor visits every year, using a series of five-digit codes (99211-99215) that are supposed to reflect the complexity of the medical service and the amount of time it typically takes. Over the past decade, more and more doctors have turned to the higher-level codes that pay more, while largely spurning those that paid less.\u000a\u000a*For counties with at least 100 claims in the sample citing either or both of the top two billing codes\u000a\u000aU.S. counties in which doctors billed the highest percentage* of the two most expensive Medicare codes for established patients in 2008.\u000a\u000aHow some medical professionals have billed at sharply higher rates than their peers and collected billions of dollars of questionable fees.\u000a\u000aThe e-book is compatible with most tablet e-reader software. Click the following links to get downloading directions for offline reading on your iBooks (iPad and iPhone) or Kindle device.\u000a\u000aIf you suspect fraud associated with your Medicare bills, please call the Inspector General's fraud hotline at 1-800-HHS-TIPS (1-800-447-8477). For information on how to deal with other concerns regarding Medicare services or supplies, please visit Medicare's official Web site at http://www.medicare.gov .\u000a\u000aThousands of doctors and other medical professionals have steadily billed higher rates for treating elderly patients on Medicare over the last decade \u2014 adding $11 billion or more to their fees and signaling a possible rise in medical billing abuse, an investigation by the Center for Public Integrity has found.\u000a\u000aMedical groups argue that the fee hikes are justified because treating seniors has grown more complex and time-consuming, both due to new technology and declining health status. The rise in fees may also be a reaction, they say, to years of under-charging, and reflect more accurate billing. The fees are based on a system of billing codes that is structured to make higher payments for treatments that take more time and effort.\u000a\u000aBut the Center\u2019s analysis of Medicare claims from 2001 through 2010 shows that over time, thousands of providers turned to more expensive Medicare billing codes, while spurning use of cheaper ones. They did so despite little evidence that Medicare patients as a whole are older or sicker than in past years, or that the amount of time doctors spent treating them on average was rising.\u000a\u000aWhile it\u2019s impossible to know precisely why doctors and hospitals moved to better-paying codes in recent years, it\u2019s likely that the trend in part reflects \u201cupcoding,\u201d \u2014 the practice of charging for more extensive and costly services than delivered, according to Medicare experts, analysis of the data and a review of government audits.\u000a\u000aAnd Medicare regulators worry that the coding levels may be accelerating in part because of increased use of electronic health records, which make it easy to create detailed patient files with just a few mouse clicks.\u000a\u000aMany health policy experts have long believed that billing errors and abuses, from confusion over how to pick proper payment codes to outright overcharges, are common in Medicare. But the Center\u2019s year-long examination has outlined their scope in an unprecedented manner, uncovering a range of costly medical coding mistakes and abuses that have plagued the government-paid health care plan for years and are worsening amid lax federal oversight.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is an urgent problem,\u201d said Dr. Mark McClellan, who directs the Engelberg Center for Health Care Reform at the Brookings Institution in Washington. McClellan, a former director of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, said the agency must send a message that it \u201cwon\u2019t stand by and do nothing \u2026 that they are paying attention to this.\u201d\u000a\u000aAmong the investigation\u2019s key findings:\u000a\u000aDoctors steadily billed Medicare for longer and more complex office visits between 2001 and the end of the decade even though there\u2019s little hard evidence they spent more time with patients or that their patients were sicker and required more complicated \u2014 and time-consuming \u2014 care. The higher codes for routine office visits alone cost taxpayers an estimated $6.6 billion over the decade.\u000a\u000aMore than 7,500 physicians billed the two top paying codes for three out of four office visits in 2008, a sharp rise from the numbers of doctors who did so at the start of the decade. Officials said such changes in billing can signal overcharges occurring on a broad scale. Medical groups deny that.\u000a\u000aThe most lucrative codes are billed two to three times more often in some cities than in others, costly variations government officials said they could not explain or justify. In some instances, higher billing rates appear to be associated with the burgeoning use of electronic medical records and billing software.\u000a\u000aMedicare administrators have struggled for more than a decade to crack down on medical coding errors and abuses, often in the face of opposition from medical groups including the American Medical Association, which helped design, and now controls the codes. Whether they make honest mistakes or engage in willful misconduct, there\u2019s little chance doctors who pad their charges will face any serious penalties.\u000a\u000aCMS officials declined numerous interview requests. However, in an e-mail response to written questions, officials said while they believe most doctors and hospitals are \u201chonest and try to bill Medicare correctly,\u201d the agency also \u201cis keenly aware that certain Medicare providers and suppliers seek to defraud the program.\u201d\u000a\u000aDr. Robert Berenson, a former vice chairman of a federal commission that recommends Medicare payment strategies to Congress, called the Center\u2019s findings \u201cclearly significant,\u201d and said they indicate an urgent need to revamp the pay scales.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is really time to deal with this issue. There are so many perverse outcomes, including spending for taxpayers,\u201d Berenson said.\u000a\u000aThat so many doctors deviate widely from billing norms \u2014 and have done so for years with apparent impunity \u2014 spotlights Medicare\u2019s chronic vulnerability to abuse and fraud, several experts said.\u000a\u000aThomas Scully, an architect of the Medicare pay scales during his White House days under the first President Bush, is now critical of the system. He said it was put in place in order to curb rising doctors\u2019 fees, but Medicare\u2019s pay hikes have been too small to match rising medical office expenses. Many doctors have responded by picking the highest codes possible, he said.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou are going to pedal faster and code more aggressively,\u201d said Scully, also a former director of the federal Medicare agency and now a Washington lobbyist with a range of health care clients. \u201cI\u2019m not sure it\u2019s malicious. It\u2019s a fact a life,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aHowever, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services inspector general in a May report stated that payments made under the doctor-visit codes rose 48 per cent between 2001 and 2010, from $22.7 billion to $33.5 billion. The report also noted that the coding system has been \u201cvulnerable to fraud and abuse.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnd agency officials acknowledge that the surge in these billings has been driven at least partly by potentially illegal \u201cupcoding\u201d which the government has largely failed to stamp out through the years.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe have some people who will use any excuse to get more money for the services they do,\u201d said Jennifer Trussell, who heads the investigations unit for the HHS inspector general\u2019s office. \u201cThey don\u2019t see it as a crime.\u201d\u000a\u000aAMA president Jeremy A. Lazarus agreed that doctors have shifted toward billing higher priced codes. But the \u201ccontributing factors are unclear,\u201d he said in a written statement. \u201cThere could be several possible reasons for this trend, but more analysis is needed,\u201d Lazarus said.\u000a\u000aSecret Code\u000a\u000aThe current billing scales, known as Evaluation and Management codes, were unveiled in 1992 as part of an unusual and secretive arrangement between Medicare officials and the AMA, the nation\u2019s most influential doctors\u2019 group.\u000a\u000aThe AMA wanted Medicare to reward doctors for the \u201cthinking part\u201d of medicine, or their skill in diagnosing and treating illness, as well as the time it takes. Medicare expected the pay scales to cut down on billing abuses and to save taxpayers money by setting measurable standards that all doctors would follow.\u000a\u000aOn paper, the process seems straightforward enough: the lowest of the five coding levels for an office visit, 99211, signifies a minimal health problem and five minutes either spent treating the patient or supervising a nurse or other health worker who does so.\u000a\u000aThat simple visit pays the doctor about $20 from Medicare.\u000a\u000aThe top code, 99215, requires much more effort. Doctors must do two of three things: a comprehensive examination, a detailed history of the patient\u2019s health status, or make a medical decision of \u201chigh complexity.\u201d\u000a\u000aThat typically requires 40 minutes of face-to-face contact between doctor and patient and pays about $140.\u000a\u000aMedicare officials expect medical professionals to bill a range of the five fee codes because some patients require more time and effort to treat than others. The government trusts them to bill correctly and medical groups say the vast majority of America\u2019s physicians follow the complex coding rules as best they can. Medicare pays for more than 200 million office visits each year.\u000a\u000aHowever, doctors and hospitals have increasingly abandoned the lower-level codes for better paying ones. Medicare officials have largely failed to challenge these surges in billing across a broad spectrum of medicine, from doctors working in hospital emergency departments and nursing homes to family physicians and specialists seeing patients in their offices.\u000a\u000aGovernment officials and medical data experts note that sharp spikes in billing strongly suggest some doctors and hospitals engage in \u201cupcoding,\u201d by finding ways to bill for higher codes than justified.\u000a\u000aMedical groups counter that most doctors charge less than they deserve. The only way to tell for sure is to review patient records that support each of the 370 million such claims Medicare pays annually, which officials say is impractical and not cost-effective.\u000a\u000aPhysician groups don\u2019t dispute that coding errors are commonplace in medicine or that a tiny fraction of doctors may exploit loose federal oversight to fatten up their fees.\u000a\u000aBut they argue that coding guidelines are vague and subjective and that just as many doctors undervalue their work by picking lower codes as might be tempted to bill too much.\u000a\u000aThe medical organizations also argue that more elderly patients over the past decade have been diagnosed with multiple health problems that require additional time and effort to treat, a contention undercut by much health care research.\u000a\u000aAnd they cite growing use of computerized medical records and billing systems for enabling doctors to document the level of treatment they provide more easily than by hand, which pays off in higher codes. Federal officials are spending as much as $30 billion in economic stimulus money to help doctors and hospitals purchase the digital gear, and more than half the doctors billing Medicare are using it, with more expected to follow.\u000a\u000aDr. Thomas Weida, a family physician in Hershey, Pa., said that wiring up his office has boosted the amount of time spent face-to-face with a typical patient by five minutes or more, both from the amount of stored information he reviews and increased time writing and prescribing treatments. That alone could justify higher billing codes in many instances, he said.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou\u2019re having to do a lot more than you did before,\u201d said Weida, a medical coding expert for the American Academy of Family Physicians.\u000a\u000aBut digital systems also can prompt doctors to \u201ccode at the highest possible level,\u201d said Dr. David Kibbe, who has consulted with the family physicians\u2019 group. Often, that means that with \u201cthe push of a button\u201d doctors can create reams of documentation to support higher codes, Kibbe said.\u000a\u000aSome doctors identified by the Center\u2019s data analysis as disproportionately billing high codes for office visits cited the poor health condition of their patients as a key justification for doing so.\u000a\u000a\u201cI know they are high,\u201d said Dr. Brantley B. Pace, who has practiced family medicine for more than a half century in Monticello, Miss., when asked about his billing practices, among the highest in the Medicare billing sample.\u000a\u000aPace said many of his longtime patients live with multiple infirmities that require his attention. \u201cI rarely have a person who comes to me for a cold,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aData experts noted that some individual doctors may in fact be justified in billing much higher than their peers. But they stressed that the sheer numbers of physicians from a range of medical specialties who do suggests some degree of manipulation of the payment scales.\u000a\u000aBilling Norms\u000a\u000aThe Center for Public Integrity analyzed a representative 5 percent sample of Medicare patients and their claims submitted by more than 400,000 medical practitioners and 7,000 hospitals and clinics, starting in 2001. The cost analysis projected the increase in Medicare costs as more doctors picked higher codes each year over the decade.\u000a\u000aThe added fees totaled at least $11 billion, adjusted for inflation \u2014 more than half of it from higher doctor fees for office visits and the rest from other services, including treatment in nursing homes and hospitals.\u000a\u000aThe investigation identified thousands of doctors, from a broad range of specialties and locales, who adjusted their billing patterns sharply upward and netted higher fees as a result. A 1979 federal court injunction in Florida bars HHS from publicly releasing doctors\u2019 names and Medicare reimbursements.\u000a\u000aThe Center sued HHS to obtain the Medicare data but had to agree not to publish the names of individual doctors, unless they agreed to discuss their billing histories. Most who were contacted declined to do so.\u000a\u000aFrom 1999 through 2008, the number of doctors who billed at least half of their office visits at one of the two most expensive codes more than doubled to at least 17,000 practitioners. Those who quit using the two least expensive codes rose 63 percent, climbing to more than 13,000 in 2008.\u000a\u000a\u201cThose are codes we see abused quite frequently,\u201d said Trussell, of the HHS inspector general\u2019s office.\u000a\u000aIn 2010 alone, Medicare paid for more than six million more visits at the second highest pay rate than the year before. That upsurge cost Medicare more than $1 billion, government records show.\u000a\u000aSome doctors relied on the same code for nearly every patient visit despite Medicare guidelines calling for a balance because not all patients who see the doctor require the same degree of attention or time.\u000a\u000aMore than 750 doctors billed the two highest-paying codes exclusively for office visits, some for as long as seven years straight, for instance.\u000a\u000aThe changes in billing patterns vary sharply by region. For instance the Milwaukee area saw a steep jump in use of the two highest codes, from 19 percent at the start of the decade to 45 percent in 2008. The Phoenix and Salt Lake City areas also saw hefty jumps. By contrast, some major urban areas, including New York City and Los Angeles, decreased slightly over the decade.\u000a\u000aMedicare has been paying for longer and more complex office visits despite annual surveys by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing that the average time doctors spent with patients didn\u2019t change much over the years.\u000a\u000aJerry Cromwell, a researcher with RTI International in North Carolina, in a 2006 study found the average Medicare doctor visit lasted about 18 minutes, or less. Yet Medicare billing records show a sharp rise in services over the decade that were supposed to take 25 minutes or longer in face-to-face contact with a patient.\u000a\u000aCromwell said it has been a \u201creal challenge\u201d for Medicare officials to verify how much time doctors typically spend with patients. He identified \u201cupcoding\u201d as one possible explanation for the discrepancy.\u000a\u000aThe Medicare billing data do not show that patients are getting more infirm; their reasons for visiting the doctor\u2019s office were essentially unchanged over the decade. And the May report by the HHS inspector general said its review of 2010 Medicare claims found that many high-end billers tended to treat patients who were slightly younger than average.\u000a\u000aResearchers also said there\u2019s not much evidence that elderly people on Medicare have been getting sicker over time \u2014 certainly not enough to justify the sharp rise in more costly billings.\u000a\u000aEric Seiber, an Ohio State University researcher who has studied physician billing trends, said Medicare officials have yet to conduct studies to determine to what extent the pay scales are being manipulated.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere is a lot of money there and we have almost no handle on it. It\u2019s so hard to pin down,\u201d Seiber said.\u000a\u000aThe Medicare billing data also lend little support to the argument that many doctors on average choose codes that are too low. In 2008, three times as many physicians were billing only the two top codes as picked the two lowest ones, for instance.\u000a\u000aIn addition, federal officials projected that Medicare overpaid nearly $658 million in 2010 as a result of wrongly coded bills for office visits at the second most expensive payment level. Officials found underpayments to be a tiny fraction of that amount, or about $6.1 million, according to government records.\u000a\u000aMalcolm Sparrow, a health care fraud expert and professor at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, said: \u201cIf there are changes [in billing] over time costing the public billions of dollars, there should be an explanation.\u201d\u000a\u000aCoding Errors\u000a\u000aMedicare manuals state that the government trusts doctors to bill accurately and pays bills \u201cgenerally based solely on your representations\u201d in the claim.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen you submit a claim for services performed for a Medicare [patient], you are filing a bill with the federal government and certifying that you have earned the payment requested and complied with the billing requirements,\u201d the manual reads.\u000a\u000aYet Medicare auditors through the years have repeatedly detailed high rates of doctor billing errors, though mostly in obscure audits which captured little public notice and spurred little government action.\u000a\u000aIn June 2000, Medicare officials identified incorrect coding as Medicare\u2019s third most prominent error, triggering $1.7 billion in suspect payments. Much of the time, errors paid doctors too much, not too little.\u000a\u000a\u201cThese improper payments, as in past years, could range from inadvertent mistakes to outright fraud and abuse. We cannot quantify what portion of the error rate is attributable to fraud,\u201d auditors wrote.\u000a\u000aIn 2001, members of a government panel were so fed up with the payment scales that they recommended junking them. Two years later, Congress passed Medicare reform legislation that called for studies to consider alternatives to the pay scales.\u000a\u000aBut the law required Medicare officials to consult physicians\u2019 groups before making any changes, a legacy of the decision to allow the AMA to develop the codes. Medical groups have since been able to block any reform effort, according to former government official Scully and other insiders.\u000a\u000aScully said it was a \u201cbig mistake\u201d for the government to give the AMA such a prominent role in creating the doctor payment yardstick. \u201cAs a result the AMA has amassed enormous power,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aMedicare officials deny the AMA and other medical groups have outsized influence over the payment system. But they concede that the system has been left in place for years because they could not reach an agreement on ways to improve it.\u000a\u000aMost patients have no idea doctor pay scales exist because Medicare and other insurers don\u2019t typically help people decipher them. As owner of the copyrights on the codes and their definitions, the AMA controls their publication and aggressively enforces its copyright.\u000a\u000aPrinceton University Professor Uwe E. Reinhardt, a prominent health care economist, said government officials could have paid the AMA a lump sum to develop the codes, simplified them and retained their ownership for taxpayers. Doing so would have opened up the process to public scrutiny and given patients a better understanding of health care finances. Other critics note that millions of seniors might help the government check on the veracity of medical bills if they knew the lingo and how to crack the codes.\u000a\u000a\u201cI wish I had some way to check up on the billing process,\u201d said Judy Ryden, a retired community college teacher who is on Medicare and lives in Grants Pass, Ore. \u201cUnless I had a degree in medical coding I have no idea what all that means. I can\u2019t tell whether a charge is legitimate or not,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aAMA president Lazarus in his statement noted that while the AMA provides \u201cguidance for the appropriate use\u201d of billing codes, it \u201cdoes not profit in any way if physicians bill an insurer for a complex service rather than a simple service.\u201d\u000a\u000aLazarus noted that the group \u201cdoes not receive a single taxpayer dime\u201d for its oversight of the codes. He said the system \u201csaves taxpayers millions of dollars\u201d by allowing medical information to be communicated efficiently and reliably.\u201d\u000a\u000aWithout the system, \u201cthe transfer of vital information between physicians, hospitals and health plans would break down under an even greater burden of costly paperwork,\u201d Lazarus said.\u000a\u000aThe payment system also has given rise to a cottage industry of coding experts and medical practice consultants who conduct seminars for doctors that often encourage higher coding \u2014 in some cases through Internet pitches that promise doctors significantly higher profits.\u000a\u000aMedical organizations also teach their members ways to code at higher levels legitimately. In one 2009 article, the academy of family physicians noted that using the second-highest level for most office visits could put an additional $30,000 to $75,000 in a doctor\u2019s pocket.\u000a\u000aAs a result, the billing codes intended to hold medical fees in check have instead contributed to spiraling Medicare costs.\u000a\u000aError Prone\u000a\u000aToday, startlingly high rates of billing mistakes \u2014 many of them overcharges \u2014 persist, according to Medicare audits conducted in several states.\u000a\u000aIn May 2011, Medicare contractor Palmetto GBA notified more than 11,000 California doctors that it would begin auditing their claims for office visits after concluding that too many were being billed at high-level codes.\u000a\u000aAnother Medicare contractor called Trailblazer audited patient office visits in early 2010 in Virginia and found mistakes in half the records it reviewed. A similar audit in Colorado, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas reported a 91% error rate for billing for office visits.\u000a\u000aBilly Quarles, a spokesman for BlueCross BlueShield of South Carolina, which owns both companies, said \u201cinadequate documentation\u201d was the primary reason for the high denial rates in the Trailblazer audit.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn some cases the documentation available did not support the level of service billed, but more often, the documentation was not sufficient to determine medical necessity or evidence of a face-to-face encounter with the patient,\u201d Quarles said.\u000a\u000aA third Medicare contractor, WPS Medicare, conducted a similar review of doctors in Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan and Minnesota after discovering unusually high levels of the second highest code, most of them coding errors on routine patient visits.\u000a\u000aIn both cases, the audits focused on family practice doctors and specialists in internal medicine. Doctors who failed to respond could face denials of their claims.\u000a\u000a\u201cUpcoding\u201d\u000a\u000aDeliberately inflating bills to boost profits can constitute health care fraud, but few offenders face any liability.\u000a\u000aAnd chances of getting caught are very small because Medicare rarely audits closely and typically has no way of finding out unless someone on the inside comes forward and alerts them. Federal officials have recently stepped up efforts to use computers to detect abnormal billing patterns, however.\u000a\u000aMany of the more than 50 \u201cupcoding\u201d court cases reviewed by the Center for Public Integrity resulted from whistleblower lawsuits, often filed by an employee who fears retribution after alerting superiors to the billing problems. They can share in money the government recoups, and most cases are settled with no admission of wrongdoing.\u000a\u000aMinnesota family doctor David Lang offers an example. He sued his employer, the Apple Valley Medical Clinic in suburban Minneapolis, as a whistleblower after concluding that some of the 14 doctors working there were upcoding Medicare claims.\u000a\u000aHe also took his findings to federal officials, who joined the civil case.\u000a\u000aIn his suit, Lang said that when he brought up some \u201cextraordinarily high\u201d doctor billings to the clinic\u2019s board, he faced threats and retaliation.\u000a\u000aFor instance, he said he was accused of seeing patients with \u201calcohol on his breath,\u201d an allegation Lang refuted by demanding a test, which showed no liquor in his body, according to court filings.\u000a\u000aThe Apple Valley clinic\u2019s managers denied wrongdoing, though they settled the suit by paying the government more than $180,000 in December 2010. The clinic did not respond to requests for comment. But Lang, a partner in the clinic, says it now bills properly.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe\u2019ve cleaned it up,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aLang said in an interview that he believes billing irregularities are \u201cprevalent\u201d in medical offices. He said some doctors overbill \u201cconsciously and without remorse,\u201d while others may regard inflating a few service codes as a relatively harmless way to help defray rising office expenses \u2014 or to silently protest what they regard as stingy pay from Medicare.\u000a\u000aAccording to Lang, Medicare officials should publicize these cases widely to limit what he called \u201crobbing from the public.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut that seldom happens.\u000a\u000aLike many others, Lang\u2019s lawsuit file was sealed by a federal court judge with only his initial allegations made public.\u000a\u000aEven criminal prosecutions conducted in open court may not bring a significant penalty. Several criminal cases reviewed were settled with a plea bargain that not only kept the doctor out of jail, but also let him continue participating in Medicare.\u000a\u000aBilling administrator Lynne Lewis helped trigger such a case after concluding that her boss, Massachusetts pain specialist Dr. Anil Kumar, was \u201cupcoding\u201d some bills.\u000a\u000aWhen she confronted Kumar about his billing tactics, he testily told her that he did business that way \u201clong before you came,\u201d and would do so \u201cwhile you are here\u201d and \u201clong after you are gone,\u201d according to her lawsuit.\u000a\u000aThe tongue lashing didn\u2019t deter Lewis. She filed a whistleblower lawsuit against the doctor and federal authorities charged Kumar with health care fraud.\u000a\u000aProsecutors accused Kumar of fraudulently billing every new patient visit as if it were a consultation referred by another doctor. At the time, Medicare paid more for consultations than for simple office visits.\u000a\u000aIn June 2010, Kumar agreed to pay the government $586,000 in a settlement deal in which he did not admit any wrongdoing. He still practices in Stoneham, Mass., and is in good standing with Medicare. He had no comment.\u000a\u000aGrowing Tensions\u000a\u000aThough the Obama administration has made a significant commitment to cracking down on Medicare fraud and abuse, officials don\u2019t appear to have an aggressive strategy for cutting down on medical coding abuses.\u000a\u000aCMS acting Administrator Marilyn Tavenner earlier this year confirmed that the agency planned to contact as many as 5,000 doctors it identified as billing outside norms, but said the effort was \u201cnot intended to be punitive or sent as an indication of fraud.\u201d\u000a\u000aShe said the agency would focus on the top ten high billers in each Medicare region as a first step, but that it might cost the agency more to investigate suspicious claims than it could collect.\u000a\u000aThe agency, Tavenner wrote in a letter published in the May IG report, \u201cmust take into account the respective return on investment of medical review activities.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt is clear that CMS is meeting resistance to fraud-control audits from doctors\u2019 groups \u2014 and threats that some physicians might dump Medicare patients if the government doesn\u2019t back off.\u000a\u000aIn December of 2011, California Medical Association president Dr. James T. Hay fired off a letter to federal officials in Washington noting that audits of doctor billings have \u201ccreated great consternation\u201d among the state\u2019s doctors and saddled them with what he deemed an \u201cenormous administrative burden\u201d on their office staffs.\u000a\u000a\u201cClearly, physicians want their purposefully overbilling and illegally behaving peers to be found and stopped. We also want to be paid fairly,\u201d Hay later wrote in a CMA publication.\u000a\u000aHay added a threat that targeting doctors for review unfairly \u201cwill only further induce physicians to decrease or stop their participation in the Medicare program.\u201d\u000a\u000aAsked about the controversy, Medicare officials said they didn\u2019t believe the limited number of proposed audits would lead doctors to dump Medicare patients. Officials said they had responded to the letter by \u201cconducting a telephone conference and additional discussions with [Medicare payment contractor] Palmetto,\u201d but declined to offer details.\u000a\u000aThese sorts of clashes are likely to become more common. Several provisions in the health care reform law step up penalties for doctors and hospitals who fail to return any overpayments within 60 days, for instance.\u000a\u000aIn draft regulations, Medicare officials predicted the new policies would result in about 125,000 medical providers returning from three to five overpayments each during a typical year.\u000a\u000aMany experts also predict an even sharper clash lies ahead over electronic health records, which Medicare officials are pushing doctors and hospitals to purchase, and also are widely marketed for their power to document higher billing codes \u2014 and thus boost the bottom line. More than half of doctors billing Medicare used the devices in 2011, and more are expected to do so.\u000a\u000aReinhardt, the health economist, said that government must be cautious to pay health professionals properly for their work, and that under the current coding system, fees often are too low, which in turn encourages higher coding.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf it is a dishonest payment system, doctors will be dishonest,\u201d Reinhardt said.

For information on how to deal with other concerns regarding Medicare services or supplies, please visit Medicare's official Web site at http://www.medicare.gov .</p><p>Thousands of doctors and other medical professionals have steadily billed higher rates for treating elderly patients on Medicare over the last decade &#8212; adding $11 billion or more to their fees and signaling a possible rise in medical billing abuse, an investigation by the Center for Public Integrity has found.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>Medical groups argue that the fee hikes are justified because treating seniors has grown more complex and time-consuming, both due to new technology and declining health status. The rise in fees may also be a reaction, they say, to years of under-charging, and reflect more accurate billing. The fees are based on a system of billing codes that is structured to make higher payments for treatments that take more time and effort.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>But the Center&#8217;s analysis of Medicare claims from 2001 through 2010 shows that over time, thousands of providers turned to more expensive Medicare billing codes, while spurning use of cheaper ones. They did so despite little evidence that Medicare patients as a whole are older or sicker than in past years, or that the amount of time doctors spent treating them on average was rising.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>While it&#8217;s impossible to know precisely why doctors and hospitals moved to better-paying codes in recent years, it&#8217;s likely that the trend in part reflects &#8220;upcoding,&#8221; &#8212; the practice of charging for more extensive and costly services than delivered, according to Medicare experts, analysis of the data and a review of government audits.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>And Medicare regulators worry that the coding levels may be accelerating in part because of increased use of electronic health records, which make it easy to create detailed patient files with just a few mouse clicks.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>Many health policy experts have long believed that billing errors and abuses, from confusion over how to pick proper payment codes to outright overcharges, are common in Medicare. But the Center&#8217;s year-long examination has outlined their scope in an unprecedented manner, uncovering a range of costly medical coding mistakes and abuses that have plagued the government-paid health care plan for years and are worsening amid lax federal oversight.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>&#8220;This is an urgent problem,&#8221; said <a href="http://www.brookings.edu/experts/mcclellanm">Dr. Mark McClellan</a>, who directs the Engelberg Center for Health Care Reform at the Brookings Institution in Washington. McClellan, a former director of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, said the agency must send a message that it &#8220;won&#8217;t stand by and do nothing &#8230; that they are paying attention to this.&#8221;</p>\u000a\u000a<p>Among the investigation&#8217;s key findings:</p>\u000a\u000a<ul>\u000a	<li>Doctors steadily billed Medicare for longer and more complex office visits between 2001 and the end of the decade even though there&#8217;s little hard evidence they spent more time with patients or that their patients were sicker and required more complicated &#8212; and time-consuming &#8212; care. &#160;The higher codes for routine office visits alone cost taxpayers an estimated $6.6 billion over the decade.</li>\u000a	<li>More than 7,500 physicians billed the two top paying codes for three out of four office visits in 2008, a sharp rise from the numbers of doctors who did so at the start of the decade. Officials said such changes in billing can signal overcharges occurring on a broad scale. Medical groups deny that.</li>\u000a	<li>The most lucrative codes are billed two to three times more often in some cities than in others, costly variations government officials said they could not explain or justify. In some instances, higher billing rates appear to be associated with the burgeoning use of electronic medical records and billing software.</li>\u000a	<li>Medicare administrators have struggled for more than a decade to crack down on medical coding errors and abuses, often in the face of opposition from medical groups including the American Medical Association, which helped design, and now controls the codes. Whether they make honest mistakes or engage in willful misconduct, there&#8217;s little chance doctors who pad their charges will face any serious penalties.</li>\u000a</ul>\u000a\u000a<p>CMS officials declined numerous interview requests. However, in an e-mail response to written questions, officials said while they believe most doctors and hospitals are &#8220;honest and try to bill Medicare correctly,&#8221; the agency also &#8220;is keenly aware that certain Medicare providers and suppliers seek to defraud the program.&#8221;</p>\u000a\u000a<p>Dr. Robert Berenson, a former vice chairman of a federal commission that recommends Medicare payment strategies to Congress, called the Center&#8217;s findings &#8220;clearly significant,&#8221; and said they indicate an urgent need to revamp the pay scales.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>&#8220;It is really time to deal with this issue. There are so many perverse outcomes, including spending for taxpayers,&#8221; Berenson said.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>That so many doctors deviate widely from billing norms &#8212; and have done so for years with apparent impunity &#8212; spotlights Medicare&#8217;s chronic vulnerability to abuse and fraud, several experts said.</p>\u000a\u000a<p><a href="http://www.alston.com/professionals/thomas-scully/">Thomas Scully</a>, an architect of the Medicare pay scales during his White House days under the first President Bush, is now critical of the system. He said it was put in place in order to curb rising doctors&#8217; fees, but Medicare&#8217;s pay hikes have been too small to match rising medical office expenses. Many doctors have responded by picking the highest codes possible, he said.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>&#8220;You are going to pedal faster and code more aggressively,&#8221; said Scully, also a former director of the federal Medicare agency and now a Washington lobbyist with a range of health care clients. &#8220;I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s malicious. It&#8217;s a fact a life,&#8221; he said.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>However, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services inspector general in a May <a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-04-10-00180.pdf">report</a> stated that payments made under the doctor-visit codes rose 48 per cent between 2001 and 2010, from $22.7 billion to $33.5 billion. The report also noted that the coding system has been &#8220;vulnerable to fraud and abuse.&#8221;</p>\u000a\u000a<p>And agency officials acknowledge that the surge in these billings has been driven at least partly by potentially illegal &#8220;upcoding&#8221; which the government has largely failed to stamp out through the years.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>&#8220;We have some people who will use any excuse to get more money for the services they do,&#8221; said Jennifer Trussell, who heads the investigations unit for the HHS inspector general&#8217;s office. &#8220;They don&#8217;t see it as a crime.&#8221;</p>\u000a\u000a<p>AMA president Jeremy A. Lazarus agreed that doctors have shifted toward billing higher priced codes. But the &#8220;contributing factors are unclear,&#8221; he said in a written statement. &#8220;There&#160;could be several possible reasons&#160;for this trend, but more analysis is needed,&#8221; Lazarus said.</p>\u000a\u000a<h4>Secret Code</h4>\u000a\u000a<p>The current billing scales, known as Evaluation and Management codes, were unveiled in 1992 as part of an unusual and secretive arrangement between Medicare officials and the AMA, the nation&#8217;s most influential doctors&#8217; group.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>The AMA wanted Medicare to reward doctors for the &#8220;thinking part&#8221; of medicine, or their skill in diagnosing and treating illness, as well as the time it takes. Medicare expected the pay scales to cut down on billing abuses and to save taxpayers money by setting measurable standards that all doctors would follow.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>On paper, the process seems straightforward enough: the lowest of the five coding levels for an office visit, 99211, signifies a minimal health problem and five minutes either spent treating the patient or supervising a nurse or other health worker who does so.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>That simple visit pays the doctor about $20 from Medicare.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>The top code, 99215, requires much more effort. Doctors must do two of three things: a comprehensive examination, a detailed history of the patient&#8217;s health status, or make a medical decision of &#8220;high complexity.&#8221;</p>\u000a\u000a<p>That typically requires 40 minutes of face-to-face contact between doctor and patient and pays about $140.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>Medicare officials expect medical professionals to bill a range of the five fee codes because some patients require more time and effort to treat than others. The government trusts them to bill correctly and medical groups say the vast majority of America&#8217;s physicians follow the complex coding rules as best they can. Medicare pays for more than 200 million office visits each year.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>However, doctors and hospitals have increasingly abandoned the lower-level codes for better paying ones. Medicare officials have largely failed to challenge these surges in billing across a broad spectrum of medicine, from doctors working in hospital emergency departments and nursing homes to family physicians and specialists seeing patients in their offices.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>Government officials and medical data experts note that sharp spikes in billing strongly suggest some doctors and hospitals engage in &#8220;upcoding,&#8221; by finding ways to bill for higher codes than justified.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>Medical groups counter that most doctors charge less than they deserve. The only way to tell for sure is to review patient records that support each of the 370 million such claims Medicare pays annually, which officials say is impractical and not cost-effective.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>Physician groups don&#8217;t dispute that coding errors are commonplace in medicine or that a tiny fraction of doctors may exploit loose federal oversight to fatten up their fees.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>But they argue that coding guidelines are vague and subjective and that just as many doctors undervalue their work by picking lower codes as might be tempted to bill too much.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>The medical organizations also argue that more elderly patients over the past decade have been diagnosed with multiple health problems that require additional time and effort to treat, a contention undercut by much health care research.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>And they cite growing use of computerized medical records and billing systems for enabling doctors to document the level of treatment they provide more easily than by hand, which pays off in higher codes. Federal officials are spending as much as $30 billion in economic stimulus money to help doctors and hospitals purchase the digital gear, and more than half the doctors billing Medicare are using it, with more expected to follow.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>Dr. Thomas Weida, a family physician in Hershey, Pa., said that wiring up his office has boosted the amount of time spent face-to-face with a typical patient by five minutes or more, both from the amount of stored information he reviews and increased time writing and prescribing treatments. That alone could justify higher billing codes in many instances, he said.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re having to do a lot more than you did before,&#8221; said Weida, a medical coding expert for the American Academy of Family Physicians.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>But digital systems also can prompt doctors to &#8220;code at the highest possible level,&#8221; said Dr. David Kibbe, who has consulted with the family physicians&#8217; group. Often, that means that with &#8220;the push of a button&#8221; doctors can create reams of documentation to support higher codes, Kibbe said.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>Some doctors identified by the Center&#8217;s data analysis as disproportionately billing high codes for office visits cited the poor health condition of their patients as a key justification for doing so.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>&#8220;I know they are high,&#8221; said Dr. Brantley B. Pace, who has practiced family medicine for more than a half century in Monticello, Miss., when asked about his billing practices, among the highest in the Medicare billing sample.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>Pace said many of his longtime patients live with multiple infirmities that require his attention. &#8220;I rarely have a person who comes to me for a cold,&#8221; he said.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>Data experts noted that some individual doctors may in fact be justified in billing much higher than their peers. But they stressed that the sheer numbers of physicians from a range of medical specialties who do suggests some degree of manipulation of the payment scales.</p>\u000a\u000a<h4>Billing Norms</h4>\u000a\u000a<p>The Center for Public Integrity analyzed a representative 5 percent sample of Medicare patients and their claims submitted by more than 400,000 medical practitioners and 7,000 hospitals and clinics, starting in 2001. The cost analysis projected the increase in Medicare costs as more doctors picked higher codes each year over the decade.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>The added fees totaled at least $11 billion, adjusted for inflation &#8212; more than half of it from higher doctor fees for office visits and the rest from other services, including treatment in nursing homes and hospitals.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>The investigation identified thousands of doctors, from a broad range of specialties and locales, who adjusted their billing patterns sharply upward and netted higher fees as a result. A 1979 federal court <a href="http://www.leagle.com/xmlResult.aspx?xmldoc=19791770479FSupp1291_11604.xml&amp;docbase=CSLWAR1-1950-1985">injunction</a> in Florida bars HHS from publicly releasing doctors&#8217; names and Medicare reimbursements.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>The Center sued HHS to obtain the Medicare data but had to agree not to publish the names of individual doctors, unless they agreed to discuss their billing histories. Most who were contacted declined to do so.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>From 1999 through 2008, the number of doctors who billed at least half of their office visits at one of the two most expensive codes more than doubled to at least 17,000 practitioners. Those who quit using the two least expensive codes rose 63 percent, climbing to more than 13,000 in 2008.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>&#8220;Those are codes we see abused quite frequently,&#8221; said Trussell, of the HHS inspector general&#8217;s office.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>In 2010 alone, Medicare paid for more than six million more visits at the second highest pay rate than the year before. That upsurge cost Medicare more than $1 billion, government records show.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>Some doctors relied on the same code for nearly every patient visit despite Medicare guidelines calling for a balance because not all patients who see the doctor require the same degree of attention or time.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>More than 750 doctors billed the two highest-paying codes exclusively for office visits, some for as long as seven years straight, for instance.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>The changes in billing patterns vary sharply by region. For instance the Milwaukee area saw a steep jump in use of the two highest codes, from 19 percent at the start of the decade to 45 percent in 2008. The Phoenix and Salt Lake City areas also saw hefty jumps. By contrast, some major urban areas, including New York City and Los Angeles, decreased slightly over the decade.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>Medicare has been paying for longer and more complex office visits despite annual surveys by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing that the average time doctors spent with patients didn&#8217;t change much over the years.</p>\u000a\u000a<p><a href="http://www.rti.org/newsroom/experts.cfm?objectid=A97D7A2D-8F04-4FA5-9BA4E9075F9520A1">Jerry Cromwell</a>, a researcher with RTI International in North Carolina, in a 2006 <a href="http://mcr.sagepub.com/content/63/2/236">study</a> found the average Medicare doctor visit lasted about 18 minutes, or less. Yet Medicare billing records show a sharp rise in services over the decade that were supposed to take 25 minutes or longer in face-to-face contact with a patient.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>Cromwell said it has been a &#8220;real challenge&#8221; for Medicare officials to verify how much time doctors typically spend with patients. He identified &#8220;upcoding&#8221; as one possible explanation for the discrepancy.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>The Medicare billing data do not show that patients are getting more infirm; their reasons for visiting the doctor&#8217;s office were essentially unchanged over the decade. And the May <a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-04-10-00180.pdf">report</a> by the HHS inspector general said its review of 2010 Medicare claims found that many high-end billers tended to treat patients who were slightly younger than average.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>Researchers also said there&#8217;s not much evidence that elderly people on Medicare have been getting sicker over time &#8212; certainly not enough to justify the sharp rise in more costly billings.</p>\u000a\u000a<p><a href="http://cph.osu.edu/biopage2.cfm?id=48">Eric Seiber</a>, an Ohio State University researcher who has studied physician billing trends, said Medicare officials have yet to conduct studies to determine to what extent the pay scales are being manipulated.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>&#8220;There is a lot of money there and we have almost no handle on it. It&#8217;s so hard to pin down,&#8221; Seiber said.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>The Medicare billing data also lend little support to the argument that many doctors on average choose codes that are too low. In 2008, three times as many physicians were billing only the two top codes as picked the two lowest ones, for instance.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>In addition, federal officials projected that Medicare overpaid nearly $658 million in 2010 as a result of wrongly coded bills for office visits at the second most expensive payment level. Officials found underpayments to be a tiny fraction of that amount, or about $6.1 million, according to government records.</p>\u000a\u000a<p><a href="http://www.hks.harvard.edu/about/faculty-staff-directory/malcolm-sparrow">Malcolm Sparrow</a>, a health care fraud expert and professor at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, said: &#8220;If there are changes [in billing] over time costing the public billions of dollars, there should be an explanation.&#8221;</p>\u000a\u000a<h4>Coding Errors</h4>\u000a\u000a<p>Medicare manuals state that the government trusts doctors to bill accurately and pays bills &#8220;generally based solely on your representations&#8221; in the claim.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>&#8220;When you submit a claim for services performed for a Medicare [patient], you are filing a bill with the federal government and certifying that you have earned the payment requested and complied with the billing requirements,&#8221; the <a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/compliance/physician-education/roadmap_web_version.pdf">manual</a> reads.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>Yet Medicare auditors through the years have repeatedly detailed high rates of doctor billing errors, though mostly in obscure audits which captured little public notice and spurred little government action.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>In June 2000, Medicare officials identified incorrect coding as Medicare&#8217;s third most prominent error, triggering $1.7 billion in suspect payments. Much of the time, errors paid doctors too much, not too little.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>&#8220;These improper payments, as in past years, could range from inadvertent mistakes to outright fraud and abuse. We cannot quantify what portion of the error rate is attributable to fraud,&#8221; auditors wrote.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>In 2001, members of a government panel were so fed up with the payment scales that they recommended junking them. Two years later, Congress passed Medicare reform legislation that called for studies to consider alternatives to the pay scales.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>But the law required Medicare officials to consult physicians&#8217; groups before making any changes, a legacy of the decision to allow the AMA to develop the codes. Medical groups have since been able to block any reform effort, according to former government official Scully and other insiders.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>Scully said it was a &#8220;big mistake&#8221; for the government to give the AMA such a prominent role in creating the doctor payment yardstick. &#8220;As a result the AMA has amassed enormous power,&#8221; he said.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>Medicare officials deny the AMA and other medical groups have outsized influence over the payment system. But they concede that the system has been left in place for years because they could not reach an agreement on ways to improve it.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>Most patients have no idea doctor pay scales exist because Medicare and other insurers don&#8217;t typically help people decipher them. As owner of the copyrights on the codes and their definitions, the AMA controls their publication and aggressively enforces its copyright.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>Princeton University Professor <a href="http://wws.princeton.edu/people/display_person.xml?netid=reinhard&amp;display=core">Uwe E. Reinhardt</a>, a prominent health care economist, said government officials could have paid the AMA a lump sum to develop the codes, simplified them and retained their ownership for taxpayers. Doing so would have opened up the process to public scrutiny and given patients a better understanding of health care finances. Other critics note that millions of seniors might help the government check on the veracity of medical bills if they knew the lingo and how to crack the codes.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>&#8220;I wish I had some way to check up on the billing process,&#8221; said Judy Ryden, a retired community college teacher who is on Medicare and lives in Grants Pass, Ore. &#8220;Unless I had a degree in medical coding I have no idea what all that means. I can&#8217;t tell whether a charge is legitimate or not,&#8221; she said.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>AMA president Lazarus in his statement noted that while the AMA provides &#8220;guidance for the appropriate use&#8221; of billing codes, it &#8220;does not profit in any way if physicians bill&#160;an insurer for&#160;a complex service rather than a simple service.&#8221;</p>\u000a\u000a<p>Lazarus noted that the group &#8220;does not receive a single taxpayer dime&#8221; for its oversight of the codes. He said the system &#8220;saves taxpayers millions of dollars&#8221; by allowing medical information to be communicated efficiently and reliably.&#8221;</p>\u000a\u000a<p>Without the system, &#8220;the transfer of vital information between physicians, hospitals and health plans would break down under an even greater burden of costly paperwork,&#8221; Lazarus said.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>The payment system also has given rise to a cottage industry of coding experts and medical practice consultants who conduct seminars for doctors that often encourage higher coding &#8212; in some cases through Internet pitches that promise doctors significantly higher profits.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>Medical organizations also teach their members ways to code at higher levels legitimately. In one 2009 <a href="http://www.aafp.org/fpm/2009/1100/p18.html">article</a>, the academy of family physicians noted that using the second-highest level for most office visits could put an additional $30,000 to $75,000 in a doctor&#8217;s pocket.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>As a result, the billing codes intended to hold medical fees in check have instead contributed to spiraling Medicare costs.</p>\u000a\u000a<h4>Error Prone</h4>\u000a\u000a<p>Today, startlingly high rates of billing mistakes &#8212; many of them overcharges &#8212; persist, according to Medicare audits conducted in several states.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>In May 2011, Medicare contractor Palmetto GBA notified more than 11,000 California doctors that it would begin auditing their claims for office visits after concluding that too many were being billed at high-level codes.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>Another Medicare contractor called Trailblazer audited patient office visits in early 2010 in Virginia and found mistakes in half the records it reviewed. A similar audit in Colorado, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas reported a 91% error rate for billing for office visits.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>Billy Quarles, a spokesman for BlueCross BlueShield of South Carolina, which owns both companies, said &#8220;inadequate documentation&#8221; was the primary reason for the high denial rates in the Trailblazer audit.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>&#8220;In some cases the documentation available did not support the level of service billed, but more often, the documentation was not sufficient to determine medical necessity or evidence of a face-to-face encounter with the patient,&#8221; Quarles said.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>A third Medicare contractor, WPS Medicare, conducted a similar review of doctors in Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan and Minnesota after discovering unusually high levels of the second highest code, most of them coding errors on routine patient visits.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>In both cases, the audits focused on family practice doctors and specialists in internal medicine. Doctors who failed to respond could face denials of their claims.</p>\u000a\u000a<h4>&#8220;Upcoding&#8221;</h4>\u000a\u000a<p>Deliberately inflating bills to boost profits can constitute health care fraud, but few offenders face any liability.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>And chances of getting caught are very small because Medicare rarely audits closely and typically has no way of finding out unless someone on the inside comes forward and alerts them. Federal officials have recently stepped up efforts to use computers to detect abnormal billing patterns, however.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>Many of the more than 50 &#8220;upcoding&#8221; court cases reviewed by the Center for Public Integrity resulted from whistleblower lawsuits, often filed by an employee who fears retribution after alerting superiors to the billing problems. They can share in money the government recoups, and most cases are settled with no admission of wrongdoing.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>Minnesota family doctor <a href="http://applevalleymedicalcenter.com/staff/david-a-lang/">David Lang</a> offers an example. He sued his employer, the Apple Valley Medical Clinic in suburban Minneapolis, as a whistleblower after concluding that some of the 14 doctors working there were upcoding Medicare claims.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>He also took his findings to federal officials, who joined the civil case.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>In his suit, Lang said that when he brought up some &#8220;extraordinarily high&#8221; doctor billings to the clinic&#8217;s board, he faced threats and retaliation.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>For instance, he said he was accused of seeing patients with &#8220;alcohol on his breath,&#8221; an allegation Lang refuted by demanding a test, which showed no liquor in his body, according to court filings.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>The Apple Valley clinic&#8217;s managers denied wrongdoing, though they <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao/mn/press/dec017.pdf">settled</a> the suit by paying the government more than $180,000 in December 2010. The clinic did not respond to requests for comment. But Lang, a partner in the clinic, says it now bills properly.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve cleaned it up,&#8221; he said.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>Lang said in an interview that he believes billing irregularities are &#8220;prevalent&#8221; in medical offices. He said some doctors overbill &#8220;consciously and without remorse,&#8221; while others may regard inflating a few service codes as a relatively harmless way to help defray rising office expenses &#8212; or to silently protest what they regard as stingy pay from Medicare.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>According to Lang, Medicare officials should publicize these cases widely to limit what he called &#8220;robbing from the public.&#8221;</p>\u000a\u000a<p>But that seldom happens.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>Like many others, Lang&#8217;s lawsuit file was sealed by a federal court judge with only his initial allegations made public.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>Even criminal prosecutions conducted in open court may not bring a significant penalty. Several criminal cases reviewed were settled with a plea bargain that not only kept the doctor out of jail, but also let him continue participating in Medicare.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>Billing administrator Lynne Lewis helped trigger such a case after concluding that her boss, Massachusetts pain specialist Dr. Anil Kumar, was &#8220;upcoding&#8221; some bills.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>When she confronted Kumar about his billing tactics, he testily told her that he did business that way &#8220;long before you came,&#8221; and would do so &#8220;while you are here&#8221; and &#8220;long after you are gone,&#8221; according to her lawsuit.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>The tongue lashing didn&#8217;t deter Lewis. She filed a whistleblower lawsuit against the doctor and federal authorities charged Kumar with health care fraud.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>Prosecutors accused Kumar of fraudulently billing every new patient visit as if it were a consultation referred by another doctor. At the time, Medicare paid more for consultations than for simple office visits.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>In June 2010, Kumar agreed to pay the government $586,000 in a <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao/ma/news/2010/June/KumarAnilPR.html">settlement</a> deal in which he did not admit any wrongdoing. He still practices in Stoneham, Mass., and is in good standing with Medicare. He had no comment.</p>\u000a\u000a<h4>Growing Tensions</h4>\u000a\u000a<p>Though the Obama administration has made a significant commitment to cracking down on Medicare fraud and abuse, officials don&#8217;t appear to have an aggressive strategy for cutting down on medical coding abuses.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>CMS acting Administrator Marilyn Tavenner earlier this year confirmed that the agency planned to contact as many as 5,000 doctors it identified as billing outside norms, but said the effort was &#8220;not intended to be punitive or sent as an indication of fraud.&#8221;</p>\u000a\u000a<p>She said the agency would focus on the top ten high billers in each Medicare region as a first step, but that it might cost the agency more to investigate suspicious claims than it could collect.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>The agency, Tavenner wrote in a letter published in the May <a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-04-10-00180.pdf">IG report</a>, &#8220;must take into account the respective return on investment of medical review activities.&#8221;</p>\u000a\u000a<p>It is clear that CMS is meeting resistance to fraud-control audits from doctors&#8217; groups &#8212; and threats that some physicians might dump Medicare patients if the government doesn&#8217;t back off.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>In December of 2011, California Medical Association president Dr. James T. Hay fired off a <a href="http://www.cmanet.org/files/assets/news/2011/12/palmetto-letter.pdf">letter</a> to federal officials in Washington noting that audits of doctor billings have &#8220;created great consternation&#8221; among the state&#8217;s doctors and saddled them with what he deemed an &#8220;enormous administrative burden&#8221; on their office staffs.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>&#8220;Clearly, physicians want their purposefully overbilling and illegally behaving peers to be found and stopped. We also want to be paid fairly,&#8221; Hay later <a href="http://sdcms.org/article/welcome-presidency-dr-hay">wrote</a> in a CMA publication.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>Hay added a threat that targeting doctors for review unfairly &#8220;will only further induce physicians to decrease or stop their participation in the Medicare program.&#8221;</p>\u000a\u000a<p>Asked about the controversy, Medicare officials said they didn&#8217;t believe the limited number of proposed audits would lead doctors to dump Medicare patients. Officials said they had responded to the letter by &#8220;conducting a telephone conference and additional discussions with [Medicare payment contractor] Palmetto,&#8221; but declined to offer details.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>These sorts of clashes are likely to become more common. Several provisions in the health care reform law step up penalties for doctors and hospitals who fail to return any overpayments within 60 days, for instance.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>In draft regulations, Medicare officials predicted the new policies would result in about 125,000 medical providers returning from three to five overpayments each during a typical year.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>Many experts also predict an even sharper clash lies ahead over electronic health records, which Medicare officials are pushing doctors and hospitals to purchase, and also are widely marketed for their power to document higher billing codes &#8212; and thus boost the bottom line. More than half of doctors billing Medicare used the devices in 2011, and more are expected to do so.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>Reinhardt, the health economist, said that government must be cautious to pay health professionals properly for their work, and that under the current coding system, fees often are too low, which in turn encourages higher coding.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>&#8220;If it is a dishonest payment system, doctors will be dishonest,&#8221; Reinhardt said.</p>\u000a</div>

V(Natural News) Rare animals have been sitting in glass jars on museum shelves across the world for decades, but very little is often known about these specimens. And many people would say that is exactly where they belong: on a shelf, as an object of the past simply to be remembered and admired from afar.\u000a\u000aHowever, a recent scientific breakthrough may be able to breathe new life into these long-extinct species. A new technique for extracting DNA has been developed, and it\u2019s something researchers believe could be used to help bring these long-gone animals into the realm of genomic study. (RELATED: Follow more news about scientific breakthroughs at Scientific.news)\u000a\u000aRare animal specimens are kept in liquid-filled jars as a form of preservation. The liquid preservative, such as formalin, often come with consequences, however. As these creatures are left in the liquid, there is a large amount of DNA fragmenting going on \u2014 which makes them less than ideal subjects for DNA extraction.\u000a\u000aResearchers create new DNA extraction technique\u000a\u000aScientists say that while it has not been an impossible feat, conducting DNA extraction analysis on these artifacts of natural history is time-consuming, and often yields little data in return. However, this new methodology seeks to break the mold by creating a more efficient and effective DNA extraction process.\u000a\u000aTo begin their study, the research team tested their newly developed technique on 10 fluid-preserved snake specimens. Almost no genetic material from these snakes could be found in public collections. The scientists then extracted a tissue sample from each snake\u2019s liver, and exposed the tissue to heat. After heating, an enzyme was applied to the sample to digest the tissue. From there, DNA was extracted with ease.\u000a\u000aWith this new method, scientists were able to extract and sequence DNA from each of the preserved snakes. Some of the snake specimens were more than 100 years old, and one was especially exciting: it was a Günther\u2019s mountain snake from India, which had never before been sequenced.\u000a\u000aOne of the researchers, LSU Museum of Natural Science Curator and Professor Christopher Austin, stated, \u201cA genome is a complex jigsaw puzzle broken up into hundreds of millions of small pieces. We can sequence those pieces and computationally put them back together.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe team claims that the procedure was \u201cminimally invasive\u201d for the snakes, and notes that the specimens were kept fully intact for future viewing and studying.\u000a\u000aThe scientists say that their experiment has enabled them to update the family tree of snake\u2019s evolutionary relationships and say it also supported the cataloging of thousands of genetic markers for different species that date back as far as the 1900\u2019s.\u000a\u000aAustin commented that thanks to their new technique, the playing field will be broadening when it comes to DNA extractions. \u201cNatural history museums are repositories for extinct species. Unfortunately, naturalists in the 1800s were not collecting specimens for analyses we conduct today such as DNA sequencing. Now with these new methods, we can get the DNA from these very old specimens and sequence extinct species like the Ivory Billed Woodpecker, the Tasmanian Wolf, and the Dodo Bird.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWe also believe this research will benefit scientists working with rare animals that are either hard to collect or extinct but are represented in fluid-preserved historical collections. It also underscores the continued importance of museum collections in modern science,\u201d Austin went on to say in his statement.\u000a\u000aThe real question here, of course, is what kind of doors will this be opening? It all sounds very reminiscent of Jurassic Park, doesn\u2019t it? This team\u2019s intentions for the DNA sequencing were innocuous, but that doesn\u2019t mean that their new method won\u2019t be used for something else entirely. Certainly, an ethical person probably wouldn\u2019t use DNA from long-dead species to create new creatures, but not everyone is ethical.

The scientists then extracted a tissue sample from each snake&#8217;s liver, and exposed the tissue to heat. After heating, an enzyme was applied to the sample to digest the tissue. From there, DNA was extracted with ease.</p>\u000a<p>With this new method, scientists were able to extract and sequence DNA from each of the preserved snakes. Some of the snake specimens were more than 100 years old, and one was especially exciting: it was a G&#252;nther&#8217;s mountain snake from India, which had never before been sequenced.</p>\u000a<p>One of the researchers, LSU Museum of Natural Science Curator and Professor Christopher Austin, stated, &#8220;A genome is a complex jigsaw puzzle broken up into hundreds of millions of small pieces. We can sequence those pieces and computationally put them back together.&#8221;</p>\u000a<p>The team claims that the procedure was &#8220;minimally invasive&#8221; for the snakes, and notes that the specimens were kept fully intact for future viewing and studying.</p>\u000a<p>The scientists say that their experiment has enabled them to update the family tree of snake&#8217;s &#160;evolutionary relationships and say it also supported the cataloging of thousands of genetic markers for different species that date back as far as the 1900&#8217;s.</p>\u000a<p>Austin commented that thanks to their new technique, the playing field will be broadening when it comes to DNA extractions. &#8220;Natural history museums are repositories for extinct species. Unfortunately, naturalists in the 1800s were not collecting specimens for analyses we conduct today such as DNA sequencing. Now with these new methods, we can get the DNA from these very old specimens and sequence extinct species like the Ivory Billed Woodpecker, the Tasmanian Wolf, and the Dodo Bird.&#8221;</p>\u000a<p>&#8220;We also believe this research will benefit scientists working with rare animals that are either hard to collect or extinct but are represented in fluid-preserved historical collections. It also underscores the continued importance of museum collections in modern science,&#8221; Austin went on to say in his statement.</p>\u000a<p>The real question here, of course, is what kind of doors will this be opening? It all sounds very reminiscent of&#160;<i>Jurassic Park</i>, doesn&#8217;t it? This team&#8217;s intentions for the DNA sequencing were innocuous, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that their new method won&#8217;t be used for something else entirely. Certainly, an ethical person probably wouldn&#8217;t use DNA from long-dead species to <a href="http://www.biotech.news/">create new creatures</a>, but not everyone is ethical.

V(Natural News) \u201cClean food\u201d and \u201cfast-food\u201d are two terms that most of us never dreamed would one day be related. But as the clean food movement continues to take the nation by storm, it seems that many popular fast food chains are catching on. For example, In-N-Out Burger \u2014 a popular chain rooted in California \u2014 announced last year that they would be moving away from antibiotic-fed meats.\u000a\u000aIn-N-Out Burger has been setting itself apart from its competitors for quite some time: the chain doesn\u2019t use frozen meats, microwaves or heating lamps. Their focus has been on making freshly made food that\u2019s a cut above the rest, and it seems that they are taking that initiative more seriously. Activists had been pushing for the beloved burger chain to make the switch, and executives finally acquiesced to their demands, making their announcement of planning to go antibiotic-free in early 2016.\u000a\u000aThe move away from antibiotic-ridden meats was a big step in 2016 for a company that only serves beef hamburgers, fries and drinks. However, the company never came forth with any dates or plans for when their food would become antibiotic-free. So, whether or not the meat you\u2019re eating there is truly antibiotic-free remains up in the air. Hopefully, more information on the antibiotic status of their meat will be made available soon.\u000a\u000aIn the meantime, there are many other fast-food places that have joined the antibiotic-free bandwagon. Not long ago, Chipotle, McDonald\u2019s, Panera Bread, and Subway pledged that by 2017, all of the chicken they serve would be totally free of antibiotics. (RELATED: Follow more news about fast food at FastFood.news)\u000a\u000aJean Halloran, director of food policy initiatives at Consumers Union, says, \u201cIf you\u2019re a consumer who buys fast food and wants to help fight antibiotic resistance, you could start by ordering chicken at those four restaurants.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBut still, we\u2019d like to see more restaurants serving \u2018no antibiotic\u2019 chicken and also \u2018no antibiotic\u2019 beef and pork,\u201d she added. Chipotle and Panera Bread\u2019s \u201cno antibiotic\u201d policies do extend to all other types of meats that they serve. Subway has promised that all of its meat will be antibiotic-free by 2025. But chicken is a start, at least.\u000a\u000aChick-Fil-A has also pledged that their chicken will be antibiotic-free by the year 2019.\u000a\u000aFast-food Gets A Grade\u000a\u000aIn the fall of 2016, six consumer health organizations joined forces to survey which chains were making the greatest effort towards serving healthier food and stop antibiotic use. The survey found that only nine of the top 25 fast-food purveyors planned on eliminating the drugs from their food supply.\u000a\u000aThe cohort of health organizations also set out to grade each restaurant and crafted a detailed report. The report, \u201cChain Reaction II: How Top Restaurants Rate on Reducing Use of Antibiotics in Their Meat Supply,\u201d was authored by Consumers Union, the Center for Food Safety, Friends of the Earth, Food Animal Concerns Trust, and the Natural Resources Defense Council. Some 40 percent of each company\u2019s grade was based on the adoption of good policies that prohibit routine use of antibiotics to encourage growth or prevent disease across all the meats they serve, and the adherence to a schedule for implementing their policy.\u000a\u000aBeyond the five major chains mentioned above, several smaller chains gained recognition for their clean food policies last year. Au Bon Pain was lauded for their \u201cNo. Antibiotics. Ever\u201d policy for their chicken and turkey, while Tender Greens was recognized for using antibiotic-free meats and poultry. The popular bake-it-at-home pizza chain Papa Murphy\u2019s was also noted for their antibiotic-free chicken.\u000a\u000aWhy go antibiotic-free?\u000a\u000aLivestock and poultry raised with antibiotics are a huge contributor to the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Healthy animals are often given antibiotics for the sole purpose of making them fatter, rather than to treat infections. Antibiotics are also used as a preventive measure to protect animals from their unsanitary living conditions.\u000a\u000aThe practice of doing this, however, inevitably creates bacteria that are able to resist antibiotic treatment \u2014 which leads to the increased potential for a life-threatening infection. The CDC estimates that some 2 million Americans are infected by a drug-resistant bacteria every year. Of those, about 23,000 will succumb to the infection and die. Antibiotic-resistance is a very real issue and it is growing more serious as time goes on; that\u2019s why these initiatives are imperative.\u000a\u000aHopefully, 2017 will bring new faces to the antibiotic-free cause in the food industry.

V(Natural News) If you\u2019re an expectant mom or a parent of an infant younger than three months in New Jersey, we have some good news. New Jersey is set to become the first U.S. state to adopt the successful Finnish system of sending out free baby boxes to new parents. Just like it has in Finland, experts believe it will help prevent infant deaths due to an unsafe sleep environment or Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).\u000a\u000aSince the 1930s, Finland has given new parents a special \u201cbaby box\u201d that contains a firm mattress, a waterproof cover, and a fitted sheet that allows it to serve as the baby\u2019s first bed. In addition to offering a safe sleeping space, the box also contains newborn essentials such as diapers, wipes, breast cream, a onesie, and an activity cart.\u000a\u000aGovernment-distributed baby boxes to reduce New Jersey\u2019s infant mortality rate\u000a\u000aIn the U.S., an estimated 3,500 deaths each year are attributed to SIDS and other sleep-related deaths, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported. Of these deaths, 44 percent are caused by sudden infant death, with 25 percent caused by accidental strangulation or suffocation. The aim of the online program is to make safe, healthy choices and decrease babies\u2019 risk of death through educating parents and creating a safe sleeping environment.\u000a\u000aNew Jersey\u2019s program, funded by a grant from the CDC, is expected to distribute about 105,000 of these free baby boxes \u2013 which is the anticipated number of births in New Jersey in 2017 \u2013 filled with about $150 in materials from the Baby Box Company.\u000a\u000aTo make the box, Baby Box Co., a California-based company, teamed up with New Jersey\u2019s Child Fatality and Near Fatality Review Board. Initially, the Baby Box company started as a \u201cbaby shower in a box\u201d product meant as a gift item from family and friends. After they had learned about the Nordic maternity box initiative, the company also integrated an educational platform into their box.\u000a\u000aTo get your hands on one of the free baby boxes, you must register at babyboxuniversity.com as a New Jersey resident and include valid contact information and mailing address. After completing a 10- to 15-minute program and a short quiz to get a certificate of completion, the baby box can be collected from the closest distribution partner, or it can be shipped to your home.\u000a\u000aUnsafe sleep environment and Sudden Unexpected Infant Death Syndrome\u000a\u000aData from the New Jersey Child Fatality and Near Fatality Review Board showed that approximately 93 percent of mortalities associated with Sudden Unexpected Infant Death Syndrome (SUIDS) in 2016 were related to sleep and sleep environments. Dr. Kathryn McCans, an emergency department physician at Cooper University Health Care Hospital and chairwoman of the review board, said that a significant proportion of these deaths are due to unsafe sleep circumstances. Thus, raising awareness around sleep safety is a crucial part of the program\u2019s mission.\u000a\u000aDr. Kathryn McCans, told Huffington Post that the important thing to remember about the baby box is the real prevention and education that comes with the box.\u000a\u000aThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services guidelines for a safe sleeping environment for newborns recommend parents to use a sleep surface such as a safety-approved crib, or firm mattress provided in a box, covered by a fitted sheet to prevent strangulation or suffocation. Furthermore, nothing should be covering a baby\u2019s head. Blankets, crib bumpers, soft toys, and pillows should be kept out of the crib or box. Also, babies should be dressed in a one-piece sleeper, or onesie, and sleep without a blanket.\u000a\u000aAt the moment, the box will only be distributed in New Jersey. The Baby Box Company, however, is currently developing more statewide programs to make the boxes available nationally.\u000a\u000aSources:\u000a\u000aCNN.com\u000a\u000aBabyBoxUniversity.com\u000a\u000aNJ.govPDF\u000a\u000aHuffingtonPost.com

V(Natural News) Radiation levels inside a damaged nuclear reactor at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in Japan have hit a record high since the plant suffered a triple nuclear meltdown almost six years ago. The latest readings \u2013 described by experts as \u201cunimaginable\u201d \u2013 now pose a serious challenge as officials prepare to dismantle the disaster-hit facility safely.\u000a\u000aTokyo Electric Power (Tepco), the plant\u2019s operator, said atmospheric readings inside the containment reactor No 2 are as high as 530 sieverts an hour, which is far greater than the previous record of 73 sieverts an hour. Reactor No 2 is one of three reactors that experienced a nuclear meltdown when the plant was crippled by a huge earthquake and tsunami in March 2011. (RELATED: See more news about the Fukushima disaster at FukushimaWatch.com)\u000a\u000aA one-square-meter hole created by melting nuclear fuel\u000a\u000aTepco said recent image analysis revealed a one-square-meter hole in the metal grating beneath the reactor\u2019s pressure vessel. The hole was probably created by melting nuclear fuel that penetrated the vessel, Tepco\u2019s spokesman Tatsuhiro Yamagishi told AFP. Also, for the first time since the disaster, images were released showing dark lumps beneath reactor No 2. Experts believe the dark matter to be melted uranium fuel rods.\u000a\u000aEven though specially-made robots designed to probe the underwater depths around the reactors have previously crumbled and shut down due to the highly toxic conditions, Tepco intends to send another remote-controlled robot to check the actual conditions inside the containment vessel.\u000a\u000aThe robot, however, will not last long.

The latest readings &#8211; described by experts as &#8220;unimaginable&#8221; &#8211; now pose a serious challenge as officials prepare to dismantle the disaster-hit facility safely.</p>\u000a<p>Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), the plant&#8217;s operator, said atmospheric readings inside the containment reactor No 2 are as high as 530 sieverts an hour, which is far greater than the previous record of 73 sieverts an hour. Reactor No 2 is one of three reactors that experienced a nuclear meltdown when the plant was crippled by a huge earthquake and tsunami in March 2011.

The hole was probably created by melting nuclear fuel that penetrated the vessel, Tepco&#8217;s spokesman Tatsuhiro Yamagishi told AFP. &#160;Also, for the first time since the disaster, images were released showing dark lumps beneath reactor No 2. Experts believe the dark matter to be melted uranium fuel rods.</p>\u000a<p>Even though specially-made robots designed to probe the underwater depths around the reactors have previously crumbled and shut down due to the highly toxic conditions, Tepco intends to send another remote-controlled robot to check the actual conditions inside the containment vessel.</p>\u000a<p>The robot, however, will not last long.

VStatins make cells unable to repair properly, create nerve problems and destroy memory\u000a\u000aDespite health problems linked to statin drugs, FDA says people shouldn't be scared of them\u000a\u000aThe need to continually assess prescription drugs and older studies that tout their benefits\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a(NaturalNews) Statins, the widely prescribed class of drugs said to lower "bad" cholesterol and reduce the risk of heart problems, has recently come under fire after a study revealed that they destroy human health more than they work to improve it.Sadly, many people take statin drugs, which are commonly known by brand names including Lipitor, Crestor and Zocor. Prescription drug spending in the U.S. shot up to about $374 billion in 2014, representing the highest level of spending since 2001. Statins undoubtedly made up a significant portion of this spending, and now consumers who take such drugs have much more to worry about than the dent it's making in their wallets.The study, which was published in the, states that statins' "...impact on other biologic properties of stem cells provides a novel explanation for their adverse clinical effects." Specifically, the study states that such adverse effects include advancing the "process of aging" and also notes that "...long-term use of statins has been associated with adverse effects including myopathy, neurological side effects and an increased risk of diabetes." Myopathy refers to skeletal muscle weakness.Experts involved in the study suggest that the health problems associated with statins have likely been downplayed through the years. In reality, those taking such cholesterol-lowering drugs have been experiencing cataracts, fatigue, liver problems, muscle pain and memory loss. Simply put, the drugs have been found to tamper with cells in such a way that their primary purpose of reproducing and helping the body repair is thwarted. With that comes the onset of terrible health issues or the worsening of existing ones.Professor Reza Izadpanah, a stem cell biologist and lead author of the published study, says, "Our study shows statins may speed up the ageing process. People who use statins as a preventative medicine for [health] should think again as our research shows they may have general unwanted effects on the body which could include muscle pain, nerve problems and joint problems."While the FDA notes on its web site that "Cognitive (brain-related) impairment, such as memory loss, forgetfulness and confusion, has been reported by some statin users" and that "People being treated with statins may have an increased risk of raised blood sugar levels and the development of Type 2 diabetes," they also maintain its safety and effectiveness. The site directs people's attention to the advice of Amy G. Egan, M.D., M.P.H., who is the deputy director for safety in the FDA's Division of Metabolism and Endocrinology Products (DMEP). She says, "This new information should not scare people off statins. Their benefit is indisputable, but they need to be taken with care and knowledge of their side effects."Indisputable? Especially after this latest study, we beg to differ. What's beneficial about accelerated aging, cells that don't properly function, muscle weakness and memory loss?This finding demonstrates the importance of revisiting the so-called benefits of prescription drugs, something that hopefully continues so consumers can be fully informed and kept in the best health possible.A similar eye-opening study involving the adolescent antidepressant Paxil recently made headlines when a reanalysis of an original study exposed errors and incomplete information. In reality, the drug was found not to be safe and effective for its intended demographic after all, a finding that Brian Nosek, a professor of psychology at the University of Virginia, says "signals that the community is waking up, checking its work and doing what science is supposed to do \u2014 self-correct."

V(Natural News) Imagine, if you will, America\u2019s cities being turned into battlefields. The sidewalks where average civilians once walked would be turned into paths for U.S. soldiers armed with weapons and bulletproof armor. The cars that once filled the streets would be replaced with military vehicles and tanks. Scattered fires and broken windows would be something you would see on every other block.\u000a\u000aSounds dark, doesn\u2019t it? Truth be told, it may one day become a reality. (RELATED: Read about how martial law may soon be introduced in America)\u000a\u000aGiven the amount of political protests that occur today, many of which turn violent and downright destructive, the military is dedicating more and more time to train for urban warfare. Should one of America\u2019s major cities fall apart at the hands of a massive, out of control riot, the United States military will need to go in and restore order. (RELATED: Did you know that food riots have already begun?)\u000a\u000aIn Southern Indiana, the U.S. army owns and operates a 1000-acre urban warfare training center, which contains more than 1,500 \u201ctraining structures.\u201d These structures are meant to simulate houses, apartment buildings, schools, hospitals, and other facilities that you would typically find in urban areas of the country. In 2015, it was reported that the U.S. military was conducting urban warfare training in Broward County, Florida. 200 military personal participated in the training, the goal of which was to prepare soldiers for battle in unfamiliar areas overseas. According the military, these urban locations couldn\u2019t be replicated on a practice battlefield.\u000a\u000aMajor John Spicer is a former Ranger Instructor and scholar at West Point\u2019s Modern War Institute. In an op-ed piece published just days ago, Spicer reminded readers that up until recently, armies have fought for cities rather than inside of cities. Today, however, \u201cmany armies have accepted that global population growth and urbanization trends will increasingly force military operations into crowded cities, and military forces must therefore be capable of conducting the full range of operations in large, dense urban areas.\u201d\u000a\u000aOf course, there is both an upside and a downside to a military that is prepping for urban warfare. The obvious advantage is that in the event of a massive riot where one of America\u2019s major cities is teetering on the brink of collapse, the military would be able to restore order in a relatively short amount of time. This could save hundreds or even thousands of lives, and help prevent physical damage to personal property.\u000a\u000aThe question is, once the military successfully restored order, would it withdraw from the city and return the streets to the people? Typically, the federal government is only interested in accumulating power; it rarely volunteers to surrender it on its own. If this were the case, it would inevitable lead to serious infringements on individual liberty and civil rights.\u000a\u000aThere are many people in this country who are very fearful of the idea of a military takeover in America. There have been television shows created about it, and thousands of personal stories can be found online of people who are taking every precaution. Often referred to as \u201cpreppers,\u201d these people spend thousands of dollars building underground bunkers, escape vehicles and makeshift weapons to use should society one day collapse. Most preppers have very elaborate escape routes as well, leading them to safe, often remote locations, away from civilization.\u000a\u000aShould America\u2019s major cities one day be taken over by the United States military, virtually no one would be immune from the inevitable looting, riots and chaos that would take place.

V(Bugout.news) During the recently presidential campaign cycle, the Left went apoplectic with rage upon news that a black church in Greenville, Miss., was burned and the words, \u201cVote Trump,\u201d spray-painted on the outside. Conclusion: More proof positive that supporters of GOP nominee Donald J. Trump are racists and bigots!\u000a\u000aNot so fast. Turns out the church burning was actually committed by a black member of the same church.\u000a\u000aAs reported by The Daily Caller:\u000a\u000aA black man has been arrested and charged with burning an African-American church in Greenville, Miss. last month and defacing its outer walls with \u201cVote Trump\u201d graffiti.\u000a\u000aThe Mississippi state police arrested Andrew McClinton, 45, on Wednesday and charged him with first-degree arson of a place of worship, Warren Strain, a spokesman with the Mississippi Department of Public Safety told The Daily Caller.\u000a\u000aMcClinton allegedly set first to Hopewell Missionary Baptist Church, where he is a member, on Nov. 1, a week before the election. The fire destroyed 80 percent of the church. A GoFundMe account raised more than $240,000 to repair the facility.\u000a\u000aA \u2018week before the election\u2026\u2019 Sound like something staged to rip support away from the new president-elect? You bet it does.\u000a\u000aIncredibly, Mississippi Insurance Commissioner Mike Chaney, who also serves as the state fire marshal, told The Associated Press he didn\u2019t believe the act was \u201cpolitically motivated.\u201d\u000a\u000aReally? If this act was not politically motivated, then no act can be considered \u2018politically motivated\u2019. Sounds like officialdom in Mississippi, which went overwhelmingly for Trump, is attempting to stave off politically motivated retribution (which we seriously hope does not happen).\u000a\u000aIn any event, there is little doubt that the incident hurt Trump with at least some Americans\u2013perhaps voters who were already sitting on the fence about whether or not to support him. And honestly, that can be the only true reason why this was done.\u000a\u000aBecause that\u2019s certainly how the discredited \u2018mainstream media\u2019 portrayed it, as The Daily Caller noted:\u000a\u000aThe attack, which was investigated by local and state authorities as well as the FBI, was widely attributed by media outlets to Trump supporters.

V(NaturalNews) I've almost neglected to mention this because it's now so routine, but we are regularly testing all of our raw materials and finished products for heavy metals in the Natural News Forensic Food Lab This lab relies on an Agilent 7700x ICP-MS instrument , used in conjunction with the amazing Niagara Plus sample introduction add-on from Glass Expansion The Agilent 7700x ICP-MS is a mass-spec instrument capable of extremely accurate detection of most elements -- down to single digitsensitivity. It can detect not just toxic elements like lead, mercury, arsenic and cadmium, but also nutritive minerals such as magnesium, zinc, selenium and more.I've been using this instrument for over a year now, so I've become very familiar with its operation and maintenance. I'm still amazed at the technology and its remarkable sensitivity. It's like having a sort of "X-Ray vision" into the elemental composition of foods, liquids and environmental samples. Almost anything that you can turn into a liquid can be analyzed with this instrument.This Agilent ICP-MS system was also a key piece of the science I used to invent Cesium Eliminator and Heavy Metals Defense , dietary products that help make food safer for everyone.This is also the instrument I used to confirm the continued use of the neurotoxic heavy metals mercury in vaccines .

VThe Seedy Truth About "Healthy" Vegetable Oils

p772

VOur intake of polyunsaturated vegetable oils has tripled in the last 50 years, about the same time Americans started getting fatter and sicker. It turns out that vegetable oils like canola, safflower, soy, and sunflower are not the health foods we\u2019ve been led to believe.\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s Wrong with \u201cVegetable\u201d Oils\u000a\u000aThese vegetable oils (which are really seed oils) are unstable and, when heated, turn into trans fats. Trans fats have been shown to cause brain atrophy as well as heart disease, cancer, obesity, and diabetes. Trans fats are also found in processed foods that say \u201chydrogenated\u201d or \u201cpartially hydrogenated\u201d on the label.\u000a\u000aThey are so detrimental to overall health that they have been banned in some areas and even some countries (Iceland, Sweden, Austria). Last year, they were banned in New York City and in November the FDA announced that they are considering banning trans fats in the form of hydrogenated oils.\u000a\u000aThey are a main source of unhealthy omega-6 fatty acids which contribute to chronic inflammation. If you have allergies or anything that ends in \u201citis\u201d (i.e., arthritis, dermatitis, colitis), you have inflammation. Chronic inflammation is a contributor to seven of the top ten causes of death: heart disease, cancer, chronic lower respiratory disease, stroke, Alzheimer\u2019s, diabetes, and nephritis.\u000a\u000aCurrently we consume an average of 9% of our calories from these oils. Omega-6 toxicity begins at 4% intake. So most of us need to cut back their intake by at least 60% to be in the healthy range of 2-3%.\u000a\u000aThe Truth About Canola Oil\u000a\u000aMany consumers believe canola oil is healthy because it is monounsaturated like olive oil, but few people realize exactly what they are consuming. There is no \u201ccanola plant\u201d. Canola stands for \u201cCanadian oil low acid\u201d and comes from a genetically engineered form of rapeseed subsidized by the Canadian government.

It\u2019s typically extracted with high heat, pressure, and chemical solvents which lead to the formation of trans fats. This ubiquitous oil is one you should definitely avoid.\u000a\u000aStill not convinced? Here\u2019s a quick look at how canola oil is manufactured. You\u2019ll see the process is anything but \u201cnatural\u201d.\u000a\u000aAvoiding unhealthy vegetable oils is harder than it sounds. Look at the labels on processed or prepared foods, condiments, baked goods, and snack items. You\u2019ll find these fats lurk in almost everything, even many foods from the health food store.\u000a\u000aWhile avoiding unhealthy oils will be tough, I think you\u2019ll like what I\u2019m going to tell you next. There are three healthy fats you should stock in your kitchen \u2013 extra virgin olive oil, coconut oil, and, of all things, butter!\u000a\u000aOlive Oil \u2013 Buyer Beware\u000a\u000aOlive oil has been used medicinally for over 5,000 years. Its health benefits are legendary. Olive oil is a major component of the Mediterranean diet and is believed to be a factor why people in that part of the world are some of the healthiest and long-lived.\u000a\u000aOlive oil has been found to boost the immune system, increase bone density, prevent cancer, strokes, and heart disease, lower blood pressure, and reduce your risk of diabetes. There\u2019s evidence that olive oil can improve memory and increase overall cognitive function.\u000a\u000aThere is a caveat about using olive oil, however. Much of the store-bought extra virgin olive oil is fake! Cheap and unhealthy soy or canola oils are colored with industrial chlorophyll and flavored with artificial flavorings.\u000a\u000aFake olive oil is a huge business around the world \u2013 in the Europe, Australia, the US, and even China.\u000a\u000aOlive oil is great to use \u201cas is\u201d but should not be heated. It burns at a very low temperature producing trans fats.\u000a\u000aCoconut \u2013 the Healthy Oil with a Bad Reputation\u000a\u000aCoconut oil is a very healthy fat that has an undeserved bad reputation. While it does contain saturated fat, that\u2019s actually not a bad thing. This makes it extremely stable for cooking.\u000a\u000aCoconut oil contains 50% lauric acid. This fatty acid is antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal. It lowers risk of heart disease by increasing good cholesterol and boosts the immune system. Lauric acid naturally occurs in human breast milk, but coconut is the only way to get it in your diet.\u000a\u000aCoconut oil contains medium chain fats which can supply energy directly to the brain with no insulin spike. It\u2019s this property that makes it a potential treatment for Alzheimer\u2019s and other neurological disorders.\u000a\u000aButter is Better\u000a\u000aButter, like coconut oil, has gotten a bad rap but is actually a healthy fat. So trade in your faux butter spread for the real thing.\u000a\u000aButter contains all of the fat-soluble vitamins (vitamins D, E and K), and is a particularly good source of vitamin A. It\u2019s rich in trace minerals and, if you buy grass-fed butter, is a good source of healthy omega-3 fatty acids.\u000a\u000aBut the real key to butter\u2019s health benefits lies in its high butyrate content. Butyrate is a fatty acid that offers several health benefits. It\u2019s very healing to the digestive tract. It reduces chronic inflammation. It counters neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s.\u000a\u000aButter can actually help you lose weight by improving insulin sensitivity and stabilizing blood sugar levels. Eating butter with carbohydrates (on bread or potatoes, for example) lowers the glycemic index preventing blood sugar spikes and keeping you full longer.\u000a\u000aWhen butter comes from cows that graze on grass, it contains high levels of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), a compound that protects against cancer, reduces inflammation, and makes it easier to burn fat and retain muscle mass.\u000a\u000aIt should be no surprise that the healthiest butter comes from the healthiest cows. Don\u2019t expect ordinary grocery store butter to provide the same benefits as butter from grass-fed cows.\u000a\u000aYour \u201cNew & Improved\u201d Shopping List\u000a\u000aNow that you know better, don\u2019t be one of those people who gets 9% of calories from unhealthy vegetable oils!

V<div><h3>Our intake of polyunsaturated vegetable oils has tripled in the last 50 years, about the same time Americans started getting fatter and sicker. It turns out that vegetable oils like canola, safflower, soy, and sunflower&#160;<i>are not the health foods we&#8217;ve been led to believe.</i></h3>\u000a<h2><b>What&#8217;s Wrong with &#8220;Vegetable&#8221; Oils</b></h2>\u000a<p>These vegetable oils (which are really seed oils) are unstable and, when heated, turn into trans fats.&#160;Trans fats have been shown to cause brain atrophy as well as heart disease, cancer, obesity, and diabetes. Trans fats are also found in processed foods that say &#8220;hydrogenated&#8221; or &#8220;partially hydrogenated&#8221; on the label.</p>\u000a<p>They are so detrimental to overall health that they have been banned in some areas and even some countries (Iceland, Sweden, Austria). Last year, they were banned in New York City and in November the FDA announced that they are considering banning trans fats in the form of hydrogenated oils.</p>\u000a<p>They are a main source of unhealthy omega-6 fatty acids which contribute to&#160;chronic inflammation. If you have&#160;allergies&#160;or anything that ends in &#8220;itis&#8221; (i.e., arthritis, dermatitis, colitis), you have inflammation. Chronic inflammation is a contributor to seven of the top ten causes of death: heart disease, cancer, chronic lower respiratory disease, stroke, Alzheimer&#8217;s, diabetes, and nephritis.</p>\u000a<p>Currently we consume an average of 9% of our calories from these oils. Omega-6 toxicity begins at 4% intake. So most of us need to cut back their intake by at least 60% to be in the healthy range of 2-3%.</p>\u000a<h2><b>The Truth About Canola Oil</b></h2>\u000a<p>Many consumers believe canola oil is healthy because it is monounsaturated like olive oil, but few people realize exactly what they are consuming. There is no &#8220;canola plant&#8221;.&#160; Canola stands for &#8220;Canadian oil low acid&#8221; and comes from a genetically engineered form of rapeseed subsidized by the Canadian government. The name change was a PR move due to the bad connotation of the word rapeseed.</p>\u000a<p>A major way canola differs from olive oil is that it&#8217;s not cold-pressed. It&#8217;s typically extracted with high heat, pressure, and chemical solvents which lead to the formation of trans fats. This ubiquitous oil is one you should definitely avoid.</p>\u000a<p>Still not convinced? Here&#8217;s a quick look at how canola oil is manufactured.

You will absorb magnesium from Epsom salt in the water, thus relieving the symptoms of magnesium deficiency.</p>\u000a<p>Sources: <a href="http://healthymultiverse.com/2017/02/08/the-32-signs-you-need-more-magnesium-how-to-get-it/" rel="nofollow">healthymultiverse.com</a>,&#160; <a href="http://seekingfit.com/blog/warning-signs-and-home-remedies-for-magnesium-deficiency/" rel="nofollow">seekingfit.com</a>,&#160; <a href="http://www.ancient-minerals.com/magnesium-deficiency/need-more/" rel="nofollow">ancient-minerals.com</a></p>\u000a<p>Related Reading:</p>\u000a \u000a<p></p>\u000a \u000a<p></p>\u000a                </div>

VBuzz Feed recently set their sights on a Christian couple with quite a following at HGTV. Chip and Joanna Gaines are the hosts of the very popular show called Fixer Upper, which is just about to start its fourth season. So what\u2019s the beef? In the land of ever dwindling religious freedom, as reported by Daily Wire, the Gaines were not called out for using toxic chemicals. They were not discovered as lying cheats who rip off their customers. They were not called out for shoddy business practices.\u000a\u000aThey were called out because their pastor, Jimmy Seibert, who oversees the Antioch Community Church they attend, believes what the Bible says about marriage. Buzz Feed was somewhat appalled by Seibert and his church\u2019s \u201csevere, unmoving position \u2026 on same-sex marriage.\u201d They just can\u2019t understand that Pastor Seibert doesn\u2019t give two cents about what the U.S. Supreme Court says about marriage, because he believes there is a higher law in Genesis through Revelation written long before the Supreme Court existed.\u000a\u000aAnd so, the Gaines\u2019 are guilty by association. And since they didn\u2019t instantaneously respond to inquires, they must be double guilty of this heinous thought crime. How quickly Buzz Feed must judge those who dare not conform to the their standard of righteousness. While HGTV did respond, assuring the site that there is no LGBT discrimination on any of their shows, Chip Gaines went about the business of birthing goats.\u000a\u000aAccording to Reference.com, there are 4,200 different religions existing in today\u2019s world, with 11 at the top of the charts. Christianity is in this top tier, as is Islam, Judaism, Hinduism, Baha\u2019i, Taoism, Jainism, Shintoism, Sikhism, Buddhism and Zoroastrianism. Regardless of how old any of these belief systems are, one could logically conclude that they expanded their membership rosters because people could reproduce after their own kind. That takes a male and a female. Billions around the globe still call that marriage, regardless of what the U.S. Supreme Court decrees. Could be quite a number of atheists and agnostics would agree, but the writers at Buzz Feed may still be quite upset about a belief and reproductive system that\u2019s been around a few millennia longer then their nifty publication.\u000a\u000aMaybe they ought to go find a safe space until every one they disagree with goes away.\u000a\u000a(Photo credit: DailyWire.com/Donna Ward Getty Images)\u000a\u000aSources:\u000a\u000aBuzzFeed.com\u000a\u000aDailyWire.com\u000a\u000aBuzzFeed.com\u000a\u000aReference.com\u000a\u000aScience.NaturalNews.com

VThousands of dead bees wash up on Florida beach \u2013 NaturalNews.com

V(Natural News) A strange new phenomenon has been taking place on the beaches of Naples, Florida, where since February 7, beach goers have been astounded to find thousands of dead or dying bees along the shoreline.\u000a\u000aA bee expert told NBC affiliate, WBBH-TV, that it is incredibly unusual to have bees washing up on the beach. He offered two possible reasons for the strange occurrence: 1) that the bees could have been affected by the nearby spraying of chemical pesticides, or 2) that an overhead swarm simply became exhausted and flew into the water.\u000a\u000aThough the latter explanation is certainly possible, the former is far more likely, since the death of these bees is by no means an isolated occurrence, and the blame can be laid squarely at the door of chemical pesticides.\u000a\u000aPesticides called neonicotinoids, or neonics as they are commonly known, are routinely used in monocultures and chemical-based agriculture to keep insects off crops. Neonics are sprayed both directly onto crops and used as a seed coating. Almost all the corn and canola seed in the U.S. are sprayed with these dangerous chemicals.\u000a\u000aNeonics attack the central nervous systems of insects, including bees, by binding to their enzyme nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. This excites their nerves, eventually paralyzing and killing them.\u000a\u000aNeonicotinoids are systemic pesticides, meaning they are taken up right into the plant, affecting every part, including the roots, stem, leaves, and flowers, as well as the pollen and nectar.\u000a\u000aThese pesticides have put the very survival of bees and other pollinators at risk.\u000a\u000aAs tragic as this is for the bees themselves, it also puts the very survival of humans at risk, since we are reliant on bees and other pollinators for much of our food production. According to the National Resources Defense Council, honeybees alone pollinate over $15 billion worth of U.S. food crops each year.\u000a\u000aWhile many activists are trying to turn the situation around with petitions to curtail the use of pesticides, far bigger and more urgent steps need to be taken to save the bees.\u000a\u000aThough the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has acknowledged the detrimental effects of the three most common types of neonics (clothianidin, thiamethoxam, and dinetofuran) on bee populations, it has thus far refused to place restrictions on their use. As long as the EPA continues to green-light the use of these dangerous chemicals, it will be almost impossible to win this important battle.\u000a\u000aThough we individually may not be able to affect national change, there are small changes each of us can make in our own home garden to create a welcoming and bee-friendly environment. After all, 300 million American gardens could provide a safe haven for billions of bees.\u000a\u000aSome tips for establishing a bee friendly garden:\u000a\u000aChoose bee-friendly flowers rich in pollen and nectar, and stagger their planting to attract bees year-round. Early bloomers include willows, hawthorn, and the blossoms of fruit trees. In summer, bees will be attracted to clover, calendula, and borage, among others. And late bloomers include aster, echinacea, and common ivy. Plant your bee-friendly plants in the sunniest part of the garden. Allow some areas of your garden to grow wild, with no mowing, weeding, etc. This will allow space for dandelions and thistles, which are a rich source of both nectar and pollen.

He offered two possible reasons for the strange occurrence: 1) that the bees could have been affected by the nearby spraying of chemical pesticides, or 2) that an overhead swarm simply became exhausted and flew into the water.</p>\u000a<p>Though the latter explanation is certainly possible, the former is far more likely, since the death of these bees is by no means an isolated occurrence, and the blame can be laid squarely at the door of chemical pesticides.</p>\u000a<p><a href="http://science.naturalnews.com/neonicotinoids_and_bees.html">Pesticides called neonicotinoids</a>, or neonics as they are commonly known, are routinely&#160;used in monocultures and chemical-based agriculture to keep insects off crops. Neonics are sprayed both directly onto crops and used as a seed coating. Almost all the corn and canola seed in the U.S. are sprayed with these dangerous chemicals.</p>\u000a<p>Neonics attack the central nervous systems of insects, including bees, by binding to their enzyme nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. This excites their nerves, eventually paralyzing and killing them.</p>\u000a<p><a href="http://www.pesticide.news/">Neonicotinoids are systemic pesticides</a>, meaning they are taken up right into the plant, affecting every part, including the roots, stem, leaves, and flowers, as well as the pollen and nectar.</p>\u000a<p>These pesticides have put the very survival of bees and other pollinators at risk.</p>\u000a<p>As tragic as this is for the bees themselves, it also puts the very survival of humans at risk, since we are reliant on bees and other pollinators for much of our food production. According to the National Resources Defense Council, honeybees alone pollinate over $15 billion worth of U.S. food crops each year.</p>\u000a<p>While many activists are trying to turn the situation around with <a href="https://www.change.org/p/ban-the-chemical-that-s-killing-our-bees">petitions to curtail the use of pesticides</a>, far bigger and more urgent steps need to be taken to save the bees.</p>\u000a<p>Though the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has acknowledged the detrimental effects of the three most common types of neonics (clothianidin, thiamethoxam, and dinetofuran) on bee populations, it has thus far refused to place restrictions on their use. As long as the EPA continues to green-light the use of these dangerous chemicals, it will be almost impossible to win&#160;this important battle.</p>\u000a<p>Though we individually may not be able to affect national change, there are small changes each of us can make in our own home garden to create a welcoming and bee-friendly environment. After all, 300 million American gardens could provide a safe haven for billions of bees.</p>\u000a<p></p>\u000a<p>Some tips for establishing a bee friendly garden:</p>\u000a<ol>\u000a<li>Choose bee-friendly flowers rich in pollen and nectar, and stagger their planting to attract bees year-round. Early bloomers include willows, hawthorn, and the blossoms of fruit trees. In summer, bees will be attracted to clover, calendula, and borage, among others. And late bloomers include aster, echinacea, and common ivy.</li>\u000a<li>Plant your bee-friendly plants in the sunniest part of the garden.</li>\u000a<li>Allow some areas of your garden to grow wild, with no mowing, weeding, etc. This will allow space for dandelions and thistles, which are a rich source of both nectar and pollen.</li>\u000a<li>Protect the bee habitat in your garden by being careful not to disturb their nests or hibernation sites.</li>\u000a<li><a href="http://gardentower.naturalnews.com/GardenTower.html">Make sure that your garden is organic</a>, avoiding the use of all chemical pesticides and weed killers.</li>\u000a</ol>\u000a<p>With more and more species of bees becoming extinct, their survival truly is hanging in the balance. We all need to work together to turn this situation around.</p>\u000a<p><strong>Sources:</strong></p>\u000a<p><a href="http://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/Thousands-of-Dead-Bees-Wash-Ashore-on-Naples-Beach-413107353.html">NBCMiami.com</a></p>\u000a<p><a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/055117_neonics_honeybees_chemical_agriculture.html">NaturalNews.com</a></p>\u000a<p><a href="http://naturalnews.com/2017-01-23-epa-acknowledges-deadly-effects-of-pesticides-on-bees-but-ignores-bill-on-restricting-their-use.html">NaturalNews.com</a></p>\u000a<p><a href="https://www.growveg.com/guides/plan-a-beefriendly-garden/">GrowVeg.com</a></p>\u000a \u000a</div>

VWith winter on our doorstep, many of us end up with a nasty cold or cough. While most people run to the store for over-the-counter meds packed with artificial dyes and chemicals, I prefer to go all-natural and avoid the harmful side effects of commercially available cough syrups.\u000a\u000aYou would be surprised of how many natural remedies are in your pantry right now. Pineapple juice is one of these wonderful healing ingredients to soothe a persistent cough or sore throat.\u000a\u000aIn 2010 Indian researchers tested the effectiveness of natural substances such as pineapple juice to treat tuberculosis (find the study here). They found that a mixture of pineapple juice with raw honey, pepper and salt work extremely well to dissolve mucus and soothe a persistent cough. Patients recovered up to 5 times quicker with this all natural pineapple remedy compared to OTC cough syrup.\u000a\u000aBenefits Of Pineapple Juice\u000a\u000aPineapple thanks its many health benefits to a powerful enzyme called bromelain which acts as an antioxidant to reduce inflammation and swelling of the sinuses. It eliminates bacteria and fights infections.\u000a\u000aOnly 1 cup of pure pineapple juice contains 50% of your daily recommendation of vitamin C, another powerful antioxidant to strengthen your immune system and soothe a sore throat or cough.\u000a\u000aNext to bromalain and vitamin C, pineapple is also a good source of vitamin A, thiamin, riboflavin, vitamin B-6, folate, pantothenic acid, magnesium, manganese and potassium, which are all essential nutrients to keep your body healthy.\u000a\u000aPowerful All-natural Cough Suppressant Recipe\u000a\u000aIf you have a juicer it is best to make your own juice, or opt for unprocessed natural pineapple juice instead.

V(Natural News) Seaweed is a common ingredient in Japanese cuisine. However, for the average American this mystical, slimy, spinach-like vegetable is something they only know from sushi rolls or miso soup. Many may not even know it is edible, let alone know how to prepare a meal with it.\u000a\u000aWhile it may not look very appetizing to you, this green, red, or brown sea vegetable is high in essential nutrients and packs a variety of health benefits including cancer prevention and protection from radiation or oxidative stress. Some studies even claim it can stop cancer in its tracks. (RELATED: Follow the latest news on Fukushima at FukushimaWatch.com)\u000a\u000aOne of the latest studies to identify the cancer-fighting properties of a particular type of seaweed was performed at the USCI University in Malaysia. They found that K. alvarezii, a red seaweed, may slow down breast tumor growth.\u000a\u000aSeaweed, so much more than a sushi roll wrapping\u000a\u000aRed seaweed is a rich source of protein and various antioxidants, vitamins, minerals, trace elements, and other beneficial compounds not found in any other food. Iodine is one of those nutrients that\u2019s hard to come by. Iodine is essential to a proper working thyroid gland. The thyroid is an import organ, responsible for the production and regulation of many of our hormones. (RELATED: Learn more about the importance of iodine at Iodine.news.)\u000a\u000aNext to providing our body with a host of essential nutrients, regular consumption of seaweed may help reduce the risk of developing several types of cancer, breast cancer in particular.\u000a\u000aFor their study, the Malaysian researchers tested various concentrations of a red seaweed extract on rats with breast tumors. They found that even the lowest concentration of 1.0mg/mL was able to inhibit the growth of MCF-7 breast cancer cells.\u000a\u000aBased on their observations, the team noted that K. alvarezii extracts were not only slowing down growth but also causing apoptosis, or cell death, of the MCF-7 cells.

V(Natural News) Milo Yiannopoulos has been attracting violent opposition crowds at many of his recent speaking events. Several media outlets have been heavily mislabeling him, which could have helped draw out the angry crowds to his recent scheduled performances. At a UC Berkeley event, Trump supporters were victims of violent left wing attacks. Fists were flying outside of the campus event, where Milo supporters were struck with flag poles and stomped while they were down. Literal fireworks also added to the mayhem in efforts to shut down the event. An interviewee was also pepper sprayed while speaking with reporters. Something is clearly amiss with both the violent demonstration against free speech and the aftermath.\u000a\u000aMany people on the left-wing are speaking out about the attacks, but not in the manner you would expect; they are standing up for the attackers. The haters are saying they don\u2019t condone hate speech, including Berkeley\u2019s mayor who condoned the riots as a reaction to hate speech. If only they could realize how hypocritical they are. The mainstream media have been legitimizing these anti-right wing demonstrations for almost two years. (RELATED: Find real news headlines hourly at Censored.news)\u000a\u000aThe media are complicit when they label the violent riots as just protests and further downplay the severity when the right is attacked. What would the left-wing owned media stories look like if the situation was inverted at Hillary Clinton\u2019s commencement address at Wellesley College? That would have also been blamed on right wing bigotry, homophobia, and racism. There\u2019s no winning against the leftist media who continue to warp the minds of Americans into standing up for corrupt globalist interests. (RELATED: Read MediaFactWatch.com for more news about the lying left-wing media.)\u000a\u000aDonald Trump responded to the recent riots with a threat to cease federal funding to the university. A statement from UC Berkeley condemned both Milo\u2019s presence at the university and his perspectives. They called him a troll and provocateur who aims hate speech at a wide array of groups and individuals. The university is essentially blaming Milo\u2019s opinions and behavior for the violent displays against Trump supporters. The worst part is that many people don\u2019t know or understand what types of discussions actually take place at a Milo event, they just know they oppose him because the media tells them to.\u000a\u000aIf you don\u2019t like Milo, the simple solution is to not show up at his events. The attacks went far beyond just Milo; Trump supporters were the prime targets for the rioters. If only the left-wing supporters could realize the façade they are fighting for is ultimately designed to work against them. If funding terrorists, depopulating the planet, and being enslaved by a one-world government sounds appealing to you, then keep on rioting. The media will continue to stand against Donald Trump and his supporters every at every chance possible.

V(Natural News) Vaccinations are supposed to help humans become immune to infectious diseases by providing the body with a tiny bit of the infection so it can later recognize the pathogens, bacteria or virus and create a ready-made defense system for defeating the real deal later. That\u2019s the philosophy, but whether vaccines really work anymore is a \u201cshot in the dark,\u201d especially when considering the influenza vaccine, a.k.a. the flu shot.\u000a\u000aNews, much like a virus, can infect a person, especially when they\u2019re hit with large doses, over and over. That\u2019s why the mainstream media circulates fake news scripts over and over, citing each other\u2019s fake news as their primary source, not relying on any facts or actual research whatsoever.\u000a\u000aAfter enough of these \u201cinjections\u201d of lies and deceit, the general public tends to believe just about anything.\u000a\u000aLately, the biggest fake news has come from the fake news specialists, calling the real news fake news. Stay with us now, because this gets a little \u201cbloody,\u201d but it\u2019s ultra-important to be able to distinguish and differentiate the fake news from the real news.\u000a\u000aThe fake news casters are running a reverse psychology scheme so people will identify real news as fake\u000a\u000aCambridge scientists are supposedly hard at work, creating a \u201cfake news vaccine\u201d to help the sheeple in the UK (and the USA) believe that their mass media outlets deliver real news. The theory is that if they deliver small doses of bogus news claims to their fans, everybody will suddenly wake up to the fact that social media has lots of fake news headlines, and then dirty politics will all be cleaned up nicely, and nobody will ever fall for the fake news sickness again. Here\u2019s how the \u201cvaccine\u201d works.\u000a\u000aIn order to immunize the population against fake news syndrome, researchers have devised psychological tools to \u201ctarget fact distortion.\u201d That means that fake news outlets (who masquerade as purveyors of truth), will now publish more fake news to cancel out the current fake news that they claim everyone else is spreading like a virus \u2013 this regarding everything from elections to wars, and from food to medicine.\u000a\u000aWant to avoid misinformation? Turn the TV off and burn your newspaper\u000a\u000aYes, you heard that right, the University of Cambridge study\u2019s lead author, Dr. Sander van der Linden, says \u201cmisinformation can be sticky, spreading and replicating like a virus.\u201d The strategy is to provide a \u201ccognitive repertoire\u201d (you can\u2019t make this stuff up) to help readers and listeners \u201cbuild up resistance to misinformation.\u201d This, they claim, will make the public less \u201csusceptible\u201d to fake news.\u000a\u000aHere\u2019s a thought: Just turn off your TV and burn your newspaper!\u000a\u000aThe study, which was actually published in the journal Global Challenges (for the mentally challenged, obviously) was supposedly conducted as a \u201cdisguised experiment\u201d on more than 2,000 US residents who were presented with information about global warming, the greatest hoax of the 21st century.\u000a\u000aThis is all basically being done in response to the fact that in winning the election, President Donald J. Trump exposed the mainstream media as fake news; their polls as fake polls; violence at his rallies as funded and staged by the Clinton campaign; the \u201cRussian hacking\u201d of the DNC as really done by a whistleblower from inside the DNC who was part of the Bernie Sanders campaign; and exposed the fact that Hillary Clinton was handed the questions for the debates ahead of time.\u000a\u000aThen, social media spread the news like wildfire \u2013 like an \u201cinfectious, viral pandemic\u201d (pun intended). From WikiLeaks to the Veritas videos, the lamestream media were completely exposed as the shills and charlatans they really are.\u000a\u000aAnd that puts us here, with \u201cresearchers\u201d creating a \u201cfake news vaccine\u201d that\u2019s way too little and way too late.\u000a\u000aGoogle and Facebook are behind the latest attempts to black out any real news exposing fraud and scripted lies being handed down by US and UK governments.\u000a\u000aGerman officials are supposedly now creating a \u201cspecial government unit\u201d to combat fake news (squash the real news about the government\u2019s fake news), in the run-up to this year\u2019s general election.\u000a\u000aHow many millions of sheeple are infected by the contagion of government scripted fake news?\u000a\u000aFake news, if you\u2019re not aware, is when the government takes away the rights of the people, stages fake events, and leaves out important news stories so the masses will bow down to their leaders, ask for more big government, and continue voting for more free stuff. It\u2019s nothing new, but the government pretending to flesh out fake news is new, and it\u2019s like the criminals at a bank robbery pointing to the tellers and telling everyone in the bank that the employees are the thieves. Just as with \u201creal\u201d vaccines, the people getting injected are the ones coming down with the infections, believing the government scripted myths and hoaxes.\u000a\u000aBottom line? Watching or reading the mainstream media\u2019s \u201cnews\u201d is like feeding a cancerous tumor chemotherapy, aspartame, MSG and fluoridated water. It just grows and grows, infecting the host until death does its part (you vote for more big government).\u000a\u000aThe pandemic of the fake mass media is dying off though, now that tens of millions of people spread the real news.

That&#8217;s the philosophy, but whether vaccines really work anymore is a &#8220;shot in the dark,&#8221; especially when considering the influenza vaccine, a.k.a. the flu shot.</p>\u000a<p>News, much like a virus, can infect a person, especially when they&#8217;re hit with large doses, over and over. That&#8217;s why the mainstream media&#160;circulates&#160;<a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-12-10/leaked-footage-exposes-cnn-producing-fake-news-during-first-gulf-war">fake news scripts</a> over and over, citing&#160;each other&#8217;s fake news as their primary source, not relying on any facts or actual research whatsoever.</p>\u000a<p>After enough of these &#8220;injections&#8221; of lies and deceit, the general public tends to believe just about anything.</p>\u000a<p>Lately, <a href="http://science.naturalnews.com/fake_news.html">the biggest fake news has come from the fake news specialists</a>, calling the real news fake news. Stay with us now, because this gets a little &#8220;bloody,&#8221; but it&#8217;s ultra-important to be able to distinguish and differentiate the fake news from the real news.</p>\u000a<h2>The fake news casters are running a reverse psychology scheme so people will identify real news as fake</h2>\u000a<p>Cambridge scientists are supposedly hard at work, creating a &#8220;<a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-38714404">fake news vaccine</a>&#8221; to help the sheeple in the UK (and the USA) believe that their mass media outlets deliver real news. The theory is that&#160;if they deliver small doses of <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-38636042">bogus news claims</a> to their fans, everybody will suddenly wake up to the fact that social media has lots of fake news headlines, and then dirty politics will all be cleaned up nicely, and nobody will ever fall for the fake news sickness again. Here&#8217;s how the &#8220;vaccine&#8221; works.</p>\u000a<p>In order to immunize the population against fake news syndrome, researchers have devised psychological tools to &#8220;target fact distortion.&#8221; That means that fake news outlets (who masquerade as purveyors of truth), will now publish more fake news to cancel out the current fake news that they claim everyone else is spreading like a virus &#8211; this regarding everything from elections to wars, and from food to medicine.</p>\u000a<h2>Want to avoid misinformation? Turn the TV off and burn your newspaper</h2>\u000a<p>Yes, you heard that right, the University of Cambridge study&#8217;s lead author, Dr. Sander van der Linden, says &#8220;misinformation can be sticky, spreading and replicating like a virus.&#8221; The strategy is to provide a &#8220;cognitive repertoire&#8221; (you can&#8217;t make this stuff up) to help readers and listeners &#8220;build up resistance to misinformation.&#8221; This, they claim, will make the public less &#8220;susceptible&#8221; to fake news.</p>\u000a<p>Here&#8217;s a thought: Just turn off your TV and burn your newspaper!</p>\u000a<p>The study, which was actually published in the journal Global Challenges (for the mentally challenged, obviously) was supposedly conducted as a &#8220;disguised experiment&#8221; on more than 2,000 US residents who were presented with <a href="http://www.truthwiki.org/climate-change-global-warming/">information about global warming</a>, the greatest hoax of the 21st century.</p>\u000a<p>This is all basically being done in response to the fact that in winning the election, President Donald J. Trump exposed the mainstream media as fake news; their polls as fake polls; violence at his rallies as funded and staged by the Clinton campaign; the &#8220;Russian hacking&#8221; of the DNC as really done by a whistleblower from inside the DNC who was part of the Bernie Sanders campaign; and exposed the fact that Hillary Clinton was handed the questions for the debates ahead of time.</p>\u000a<p>Then, social media spread the news like wildfire &#8211; like an &#8220;infectious, viral pandemic&#8221; (pun intended). From WikiLeaks to the Veritas videos, the lamestream media were completely exposed as the shills and charlatans they really are.</p>\u000a<p>And that puts us here, with &#8220;researchers&#8221; creating a &#8220;fake news vaccine&#8221; that&#8217;s way too little and way too late.</p>\u000a<p>Google and Facebook are behind the latest attempts to black out any real news exposing fraud and scripted lies being handed down by US and UK governments.</p>\u000a<p>German officials are supposedly now creating a &#8220;special government unit&#8221; to combat fake news (squash the real news about the government&#8217;s fake news), in the run-up to this year&#8217;s general election.</p>\u000a<h2>How many millions of sheeple are infected by the contagion of government scripted fake news?</h2>\u000a<p>Fake news, if you&#8217;re not aware, is when the government takes away the rights of the people, stages fake events, and leaves out important news stories so the masses will bow down to their leaders, ask for more big government, and continue voting for more free stuff. It&#8217;s nothing new, but the government pretending to flesh out fake news is new, and it&#8217;s like the criminals at a bank robbery pointing to the tellers and telling everyone in the bank that the employees are the thieves. Just as with&#160;&#8220;real&#8221; vaccines, the people getting injected are the ones coming down with the infections, believing the government scripted myths and hoaxes.</p>\u000a<p>Bottom line? Watching or reading the mainstream media&#8217;s&#160;&#8220;news&#8221; is like feeding a cancerous tumor chemotherapy, aspartame, MSG and fluoridated water. It just grows and grows, infecting the host until death does its part (you vote for more big government).</p>\u000a<p>The pandemic of the fake mass media is dying off though, now that tens of millions of people spread the real news. Thanks to truth media, alternative media and social media, the infectious disease spreaders have been temporarily sterilized and quarantined. Only time will tell who wins the information war.

VFor generations, Americans have been taught to mistrust and even hate Russia, the power base of the former Soviet Union. And during the Cold War, that was justified; it literally was us against them, and the rest of the world could only hope that the U.S. and U.S.S.R. never came to blows, because everyone knew it would end in mutual nuclear annihilation.\u000a\u000aBut after the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991 and Bill Clinton was elected president, the U.S. embarked on a campaign to essentially neglect a Russia that was broke, dispirited and no longer the threat it once was.\u000a\u000aNATO, the alliance that was formed to oppose the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact, did not dissolve at the close of the Cold War; it was expanded, and new members included countries that had been under the influence of Moscow for decades. In fact, new member nations were added that extended NATO to Russia\u2019s traditional zone of influence, its doorstep.\u000a\u000aNeedless to say, this rattled and upset a generation of Russian leaders \u2013 one of them being Vladimir Putin, a former KGB operative who had become a rising star in Russian politics.\u000a\u000aKeep in mind that, had the reverse happened and the Warsaw Pact extended to a broke and dispirited America, there is no question that U.S. leaders would have been equally rattled and just as upset at having been taken advantage of with no way to oppose it.\u000a\u000aLike it or not, that\u2019s what the U.S. did in the years after the Cold War: It was official policy to press our advantage, largely through the expansion of NATO, against a weakened Russia that could do nothing, militarily or diplomatically, to stop us. And Europe came along for the ride. (RELATED: Stay current with American foreign policy under Trump at NationalSecurity.news)\u000a\u000aNow, two decades later, Russia is in a better place, economically and militarily. Putin, a nationalistic and populist leader in the vein of Trump, has been pressing Russia\u2019s newfound advantages in its traditional zones of influence. That\u2019s what the 2008 intervention in Georgia was about, and that\u2019s what Moscow\u2019s involvement in Ukraine is about.\u000a\u000aNonetheless, the attitude among the governing elitist establishment is one of distrust and animosity towards Putin and Russia, even as these same elitists push the Trump administration to continue previous neoconservative policies of endless war and continual conflict.\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s the point of that? Money: The military-industrial complex is hungry and must constantly be fed. But Trump seems to want to move away from that \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d cycle, which helps explain his desire to have a better working relationship with a country that is well-stocked with nuclear weapons and, frankly, may have a bit of an axe to grind with the U.S. \u2013 right or wrong.\u000a\u000aFor this, Trump has been vilified. His outward displays of respect for Putin have led the hysterically inaccurate establishment media to label him a lackey of Russia who was aided in his electoral victory by Russian propaganda.\u000a\u000aWell, he\u2019s about to be vilified anew. Trump was interviewed by Fox News\u2019 Bill O\u2019Reilly before the Super Bowl, in which the president said he had \u201crespect\u201d for Putin.\u000a\u000a\u201cI do respect him,\u201d Trump said, prompting an incredulous O\u2019Reilly to ask, \u201cWhy?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWell, I respect a lot of people, but that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019ll get along with them,\u201d Trump said, adding that if Russia helps the U.S in its fight against ISIS and global Islamic terrorism, \u201cthat\u2019s a good thing.\u201d\u000a\u000aPressing him, O\u2019Reilly said that Putin \u201cis a killer,\u201d to which Trump responded, honestly, \u201cThere are a lot of killers. We\u2019ve got a lot of killers. What, do you think our country is so innocent?\u201d\u000a\u000aThis will set the establishment off, no doubt, making the liberal Ivy League-educated foreign policy establishment in the State Department and elsewhere even more unhinged.

VMost people know that noodles are not a health food. But only a few know about their severe side effects.\u000a\u000aResearchers say that instant noodles are one of the worst foods you can put in your mouth. Dr. Braden Kuo made this video to show what happens in the digestive tract when we eat instant noodles.\u000a\u000aIn the video, Dr. Braden compares how instant noodles and homemade noodles react in the stomach. He discovered that instant noodles didn\u2019t break down after being in the stomach for over 2 hours. But homemade noodles were easily broken down.\u000a\u000aThis is very unusual since most processed foods are easily broken down in the digestive tract (because they lack fiber). In fact, instant noodles end up overworking the digestive system. But that\u2019s not the worst part.\u000a\u000aNoodles contain a toxic additive called tertiary butyl hydroquinone (TBHQ). You may notice that some ingredient lists say that TBHQ is an antioxidant, but that\u2019s far from the truth. It\u2019s simply a synthetic chemical with antioxidant properties.\u000a\u000aYou will find TBHQ in most unhealthy ingredients including pesticides, perfumes, varnishes and most McDonald\u2019s foods.\u000a\u000aResearch shows that consuming 5 grams of this chemical can be lethal. And exposure to small amounts can cause nausea, vomiting, collapse, tinnitus, and delirium.\u000a\u000aThe good this is that our bodies can get rid of this toxin and prevent build-up. But consistent exposure can be harmful, studies show.\u000a\u000aInstant noodles can cause metabolic syndrome\u000a\u000aAccording to this study, people who consume instant noodles regularly have a higher risk of metabolic syndrome, whether they exercise or not. It\u2019s was further discovered that women had a 68 percent higher risk of metabolic syndrome when they consumed instant noodles more than twice a week.\u000a\u000aAnd you know what \u2013 metabolic syndrome is known to cause weight gain, inflammation, heart disease, diabetes and high blood pressure.\u000a\u000aMost instant noodles also contain toxic chemicals including: Monosodium Glutamate (MSG), Benzopyrene, and Glutamic acid.\u000a\u000aMonosodium Glutamate has been linked to Alzheimer\u2019s disease, low testosterone levels and Parkinson\u2019s disease.\u000a\u000aIf you struggle with belly fat or want to lose weight without starving yourself, watch the 2-MINUTE trick that shrinks belly fat.

VRemember when the Democrat-media complex went bananas because then-presidential candidate Donald Trump refused to commit in advance to accepting the results of the election?\u000a\u000aHis caution was understandable, given the primitive registration, absentee ballot, and in-person voting procedures currently in effect in our country that makes the process wide-open to fraud, especially in those states where photo ID is not required or where Obama-appointed judges have blocked voter ID laws from going into effect.\u000a\u000aAfter the election, Democrat Hillary Clinton and Green Party standard-bearer Jill Stein and their operatives all of a sudden concluded that raising questions about the outcome was no longer un-American. For reasons known only to herself, moreover, Stein never sought a recount in states that Clinton narrowly won.\u000a\u000aDuring this time, amnesia overcame the media about their previous outrage over the very idea of contesting the election. President Trump has properly described the media as the \u201copposition party.\u201d\u000a\u000aAgainst this backdrop, recall that Obama and his fawning media entourage ridiculed Mitt Romney when the 2012 GOP hopeful warned about Russia\u2019s intentions. Yet for the past six months or so, the Democrats and their journalistic sycophants have behaved like they can\u2019t wait to launch World War 3 against Russia for supposedly interfering in the election through email hacking. Their saber rattling against Putin seems to have finally faded with the Trump controversy du jour taking its place.\u000a\u000aThis is the same Trump-attacking mainstream media fakestream media (as Health Ranger Mike Adams calls it) that now portrays Romney and John McCain as respected statesman after unmercifully trashing both in the prior to election cycles.\u000a\u000aThis ties in to the video embedded below created by HeatStreet which exposes the hypocrisy of the fakestream media in the way it covered the Tea Party during the Obama administration.\u000a\u000aAccording to various reports, left-wing billionaire George Soros help bankroll the Women\u2019s March in Washington, D.C. the day after Inauguration Day (the event where Madonna dropped F-bombs as well as telling the crowd of her thoughts about blowing up the White House now that Donald Trump has moved in).\u000a\u000aWith Madonna as one example, it\u2019s ironic, isn\u2019t it, given the edgy way celebrities generally behave on and off camera, that they would denounce Trump for the freewheeling, politically incorrect manner in which he conducts himself?\u000a\u000aWhile Trump \u2014 a former Democrat and independent who ran for president as a Republican \u2014 regularly mixed with celebrities, and they with him, during his high-visibility career in and out of show business, that was then and this is now.\u000a\u000aLike their counterparts in the group-thinking liberal corporate media echo chamber, many in the stage and screen industry apparently are still having trouble coming to grips with the final results of election 2016, perhaps because of the mainstream news media\u2019s reliance on flawed polling data rather than reporting about facts on the ground.\u000a\u000aThe Women\u2019s March received glowing, uncritical coverage for patriotically speaking truth to power and whatnot, and perhaps much of it was deserved on free speech grounds, although the unconventional headgear worn by some of the marchers may have been unseemly.\u000a\u000aIn contrast, the Tea Party was actually an organic movement. It was comprised of ordinary people like those next door or down the block who loved their country and the U.S. Constitution (including the provision in the First Amendment that protects the right to peacefully assemble, just like for those participating in the Women\u2019s March), and were rallying for lower taxes and a smaller government.\u000a\u000aAccording to the mainstream media at the time, however, the Tea Party was a hate-filled bunch of treasonous racists who sought to de-legitimize Obama.\u000a\u000aBottom line: The reporting on the Tea Party by the media was fake news before fake news was cool.\u000a\u000aParenthetically, Dilbert creator Scott Adams, who long predicted an election win by \u201cmaster persuader\u201d Donald Trump, has come up with a drinking game for each time CNN, a.k.a. the Clinton News Network, describes the Trump administration as being engulfed in chaos.\u000a\u000aSources:\u000a\u000aHeatSt.com\u000a\u000aNaturalNews.com\u000a\u000aTheFederalist.com\u000a\u000aBlog.Dilbert.com\u000a\u000aInquisitr.com

VThere are multiple tragedies converging in the aftermath of the devastating fire that killed thirty six people, or more, in an Oakland, California warehouse. The space had become a community and home to musicians, writers, artists, and unemployed free spirits who, if not for this facility, would have had no food, no place to lay their head and no support for their work. Derick Ion Almena is the man holding the lease and is under criminal investigation. Almena was also the prime tenant and leader of the collective. He lived in this space with Micah Allison, his wife, and their three young children.\u000a\u000aThe Daily Mail describes the warehouse as an \u201cillegal enclave\u201d filled with \u201cjunk.\u201d Altars and displays of religious and cultic imagery were an integral part of what residents called the \u201cGhost Ship or the Satya Yuga Collective,\u201d which refers to a Hindi theology. These displays featured Hindi gods, Shiva and Kali, but not exclusively. Skulls, crosses, swastikas, unicorns, candles, statues and African tribal masks were also prominent. These items were highly flammable, as are the accusations that former residents have testified to in court before the tragic fire.\u000a\u000aAlmena claims he simply wanted to offer shelter and support for artists in need. His desire was for a creative community. Testimony from others as to his intentions are mixed. Last year, Almena was \u201caccused by artists and events producers of stealing equipment, breaking contracts, and making violent threats. . .\u201d It is also claimed he held people captive or told them what to do with the threat of being kicked out. Other descriptions of Almena\u2019s personality detail a charismatic nature that turned into a cult-like stature. But in this interview with NBC\u2019s Matt Lauer, Almena\u2019s shock and grief over the event appear evident.\u000a\u000aDailymail.co.uk suggests that Hindi blood rituals may have taken place at this \u201cGhost Ship,\u201d yet evidence for that accusation seems inconclusive. A supporter and friend of Almena, artist Anthony Perrault, was the a lone voice in defending the intentions of the man who will most likely be held accountable for the homicide of thirty six individuals, along with multiple city housing code violations.\u000a\u000aThere were survivors in this devastating fire, and their interview demonstrates another very real tragedy in this story. In many collapsing cities where housing is unaffordable, people gather together in slip shod buildings to do the best they can. Many have no other option.\u000a\u000aSources:\u000a\u000aDailyMail.co.uk\u000a\u000aYouTube.com\u000a\u000aYouTube.com\u000a\u000a(Photo credit: Dailymail.co.uk)

V(Natural News) As the theory of man-made climate change continues to crumble, especially with the incoming Trump administration, one of the biggest names perpetuating its merits is taking a new approach to dealing with detractors: lawsuits.\u000a\u000aMichael Mann, a professor from Penn State who reached fame status for his \u201chockey stick\u201d portrayal of global warming trends \u2014 an image that has been thoroughly debunked, by the way \u2014 is reportedly now suing those who would dare to question his work.\u000a\u000aScientific fascism, in other words, is how Mann hopes to temper criticisms of his mythical treatise that cars, cows, and other things people use are causing the polar ice caps to melt.

V(Natural News) With the \u201cfake news\u201d left-wing media now totally freaking out about the Patriots\u2019 Superbowl win over the Falcons, you have to ask a serious question: Will CNN and the fact-less left-wing media now claim the Russians hacked the Superbowl?\u000a\u000aTom Brady, a proponent of organic superfoods and ultra-clean nutrition, has been under siege from the totally dishonest \u201cfake news\u201d media (CNN, MSNBC, WashPost, NYT, etc.) because he\u2019s friends with President Donald Trump. In today\u2019s mindless libtard media, being friends with Trump is apparently a heinous crime because Trump wants to block terrorists from entering the country. But the fact that Obama and Hillary Clinton mercilessly bombed Muslim nations for the last eight years doesn\u2019t seem to bother any Leftists, astonishingly.\u000a\u000aSo they were all hoping Tom Brady would be crushed at the Superbowl, providing the hateful Left with a small victory to help temper their long list of crushing defeats in the recent elections. At one point in the game, it looked like they would get their wish, too: The Falcons were ahead by 28-3 in the third quarter.\u000a\u000aBut Brady apparently found his \u201cinner kale\u201d and powered his way to a truly historic, unprecedented comeback victory in much the same way Donald Trump achieved his election victory on November 8th. Predictably, CNN is probably now going to claim \u201cthe Russians hacked the Superbowl!\u201d because they have no remaining ability to engage in fact-based news, analysis or reporting. (RELATED: See more coverage of \u201cfakestream media\u201d news hoaxes at HOAX.news)\u000a\u000aHollywood crybabies scream, \u201cTHIS IS NOT MY SUPERBOWL!\u201d\u000a\u000aHow did the Russians hack the Superbowl, exactly? No doubt CNN will parade a slew of \u201cexperts\u201d in front of the cameras who claim they discovered a \u201csecret dossier\u201d that was handed to Bill Belichick by Russian agents who had the dirt on little-known vulnerabilities in the defensive backs of the Falcons. The dossier, we\u2019ll be told, was written in invisible ink and delivered by Russian escorts who like to urinate on hotel beds while tossing around under-inflated footballs. This will all be cited by \u201cunnamed intelligence officials\u201d who CNN swears are telling the truth.\u000a\u000aThen, CNN will condemn the Superbowl as being \u201cstolen\u201d and demand a \u201creplay\u201d while recruiting pathetic Hollywood celebrities to produce a crybaby video of them all screaming, \u201cThis is NOT MY SUPERBOWL!\u201d\u000a\u000aAccusations of cheating will be leveled against referees, and there will be Leftist claims that \u201csome fans were disenfranchised and denied an opportunity to properly cheer for the Falcons.\u201d The scoreboard will be dismantled to look for hacks that electronically changed the numbers, and CNN experts will argue that the Falcons should have received \u201cbonus starting points\u201d in the name of \u201cequality\u201d because Tom Brady is WHITE and obviously benefits from \u201cwhite privilege.\u201d (Seriously, Leftists are already making this accusation, see the tweets below for proof\u2026)\u000a\u000aShould Tom Brady become a transgender to appease the intolerant Left?\u000a\u000aYep, the Superbowl wasn\u2019t merely hacked by the Russians; it was also yet another perfect example of what the mentally deranged Left would characterize as \u201cracist, bigoted, intolerant, xenophobic and transphobic.\u201d After all, there were no transgenders on the playing field, were there? That\u2019s transphobic! If only Tom Brady would follow Bruce Jenner\u2019s lead and announce he\u2019s now a woman, then the Left would mindlessly cheer his victory as a champion of \u201cinclusiveness\u201d regardless of the firmness of his balls.\u000a\u000aLost in all this libtard claptrap and bunkery is the simple fact that the Patriots out-played the Falcons and deserved their win. And yes, in the real world, there are WINNERS and LOSERS \u2014 something the progressive Left simply can\u2019t handle anymore because they\u2019ve become fragile snowflakes who despise competition (including free market competition).\u000a\u000aTom Brady and the Patriots are simply better at performing under pressure. They won the game fair and square. And that\u2019s what really drives the Left-wing media completely insane: They can\u2019t stand people who honestly WIN, and they will try everything in their power to condemn, demean and sabotage winners who want to achieve greatness for their team or their country.\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s why the Patriots\u2019 victory isn\u2019t just a victory for football but a victory for sanity in America. Perhaps if the Left keeps losing over and over, they will finally learn to accept it and stop trying to come up with zany, loony tunes conspiracy theories for why things are happening that they cannot explain (such as Robert Reich\u2019s tin foil hat conspiracy theory that now claims Breitbart hired assassins to try to murder Milo Yiannopoulos at UC Berkeley):\u000a\u000aLeftists claim Patriots\u2019 win was due to \u201cWhite Supremacy\u201d\u2026 seriously\u000a\u000aVia InfoWars\u2019 Paul Joseph Watson:\u000a\u000aThe Patriots\u2019 amazing comeback victory in last night\u2019s Super Bowl spawned another leftist meltdown in which the result was somehow blamed on \u201cwhite supremacy\u201d.\u000a\u000aDespite the fact that a black player, James White, scored the winning touchdown, Twitter was awash with race-obsessed liberals who thought the unprecedented comeback was some kind of conspiracy.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf the Patriots win, this is white supremacy working.

This is what happens when Trump picks your team to win. 21-3. Halftime. #RiseUp.\u201d\u000a\u000aLOL. \U0001f604 pic.twitter.com/OUPk6cx0pX \u2014 Paul Joseph Watson (@PrisonPlanet) February 6, 2017\u000a\u000aAfter the Patriots stormed back to claim a 34-28 victory, King deleted the original tweet and then tweeted, \u201cThe biggest collapse in Super Bowl history. That hurts. Sorry Atlanta. We\u2019ll be back next year.\u201d\u000a\u000aSince the left seemed very eager to racialize and politicize a game of football, Trump supporters were only too happy to oblige, tweeting a series of memes under the hashtag #NotMySuperBowlChamps.

VThe Democratic Party and its angry left-wing sycophants have become completely unhinged since they were bested by a former reality TV star and billionaire businessman, and you see them unraveling daily without having to put much effort into it.\u000a\u000aConsider what Tim Kaine, Hillary Clinton\u2019s vice presidential pick and a sitting U.S. senator just suggested: That the Left would rather relive the 1960s and foment war on our streets and on our campuses than do the civilized thing after losing election after election all around the country \u2014 reevaluate, adopt a new message, and try to reconnect with a majority of the American people.\u000a\u000aIn an interview with little-watched MSNBC, \u201cMorning Joe\u201d co-host Mika Brzezinski asked Kaine about the future of his part and what needs to happen moving forward for it to remain a viable force in American politics, as reported by Breitbart. (RELATED: What is the media misreporting today? Find out at MediaFactWatch.com)\u000a\u000a\u201cSo, broad question about the future of the Democratic Party, especially given your firsthand experience with what we\u2019ve all been through,\u201d she began. \u201cThere\u2019s so much going on here that we clearly see, you know, places where you \u2014 we can criticize what the administration is doing, but how does the party rebuild? How do you prevent overreach in a situation like this? How do you prevent a continuation of the bubble in a situation like this, and how does the party reclaim its reach across the country while fighting these battles?\u201d\u000a\u000aKaine\u2019s response is something you might have expected to hear a member of Congress utter 50 years ago \u2013 and it is very telling as to what kind of party the Democrats have become (the Anarchy Party).\u000a\u000a\u201cWell, let me talk about continuation of the bubble, Mika. This is something I\u2019m so excited about. I saw that Howard Dean tweeted at me the other day, \u2018Tim, the base is getting ahead of the leaders.\u2019 That\u2019s exactly backward,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are so excited that the American public is energized to speak out against the abuses of this administration. Democratic senators led healthcare rallies \u2014 Save Our Healthcare \u2014 on Martin Luther King Day in about 75 cities around the country, including Richmond. Tens of thousands of people rallied to save our health care. Then, the Women\u2019s March that was organized at a grassroots level. Then, people coming out in protest of these orders. So, the way we get outside the bubble is we take advantage of this tremendous public outcry against the administration. What we\u2019ve got to do is fight in Congress, fight in the courts, fight in the streets, fight online, fight at the ballot box, and now there\u2019s the momentum to be able to do this. And we\u2019re not afraid of the popular outcry, we\u2019re energized by it and that\u2019s going to help us do our job and do it better.\u201d\u000a\u000aThat is an incredibly irresponsible thing for any public official to say, let alone a current U.S. senator and a man who, just a few months ago, was in the running to become vice president of the United States.\u000a\u000aNow flip this, and imagine if President Donald Trump had told an interviewer Republicans were going to ride the wave of momentum for his victory and \u201cfight in the streets\u201d any opposition to his policies; he would most definitely sound as crazy as the angry Left is attempting to make him out to be. (RELATED: Watch the angry Left continue to destroy the civil society at Collapse.news)\u000a\u000aMuch of the \u201cmomentum\u201d that Kaine is talking about is manufactured \u2013 bought and paid for with money from Democratic Party puppet master George Soros \u2013 which means, there isn\u2019t really much enthusiasm for it outside reliably Left-wing pockets of political ideology in cities and college campuses. If there really were massive support for him and his twice-failed presidential running mate, she would be sitting in the Oval Office today (along with her major Clinton Foundation donors), not Trump.\u000a\u000aStill, every society has its anarchists and it appears as though official Democratic Party strategy is to tap into that faction, then manufacture and support civil unrest and domestic terrorism. To toss out a suggestion that we should all be fighting this out in the streets of our cities is like tossing gasoline onto a fire, and Kaine should be held to account for that during these highly volatile times.\u000a\u000aHe cannot be held legally liable for his comments, which are really akin to fomenting domestic insurrection, because he\u2019s protected from prosecution as a sitting U.S. senator. He can, however, be expelled, under Article I, Section 5 of the Constitution.\u000a\u000aWhat are you waiting for, members of the Senate?

V(Natural News) Even before Donald J. Trump handed Hillary Clinton a second humiliating loss in her bid for the White House, angry mobs, egged on by Left-wing financiers and professional rabble-rousers, were using the Constitution\u2019s First Amendment as a cover to trash entire city blocks, injure police officers and attack innocent Americans.\u000a\u000aAfter Trump won the election, the protests continued, and have grown in ferocity and destruction. And today, no matter what Trump does \u2013 even if he does something that every previous president has done, including the Left\u2019s darling, Barack Obama \u2013 it is used as just another reason to justify more violence.\u000a\u000aThis kind of scene is being repeated \u2013 over and over and over again, in city after city across the country. And it\u2019s not Trump supporters who are committing this violence; by and large, it\u2019s coming from the angry Left.\u000a\u000aGranted, many of these are young people who are simply being played by puppet masters like Al Sharpton, Jesse Jackson, the Democratic Party and George Soros \u2013 the political figures overtly call for \u201caction,\u201d while behind-the-scenes financiers like Soros provide the funding.\u000a\u000aWhat we\u2019re left with is a toxic brew of lies, falsehoods, mistrust and pure hatred. (RELATED: Our civil society is breaking down, and we track and document it at Collapse.news)\u000a\u000aSo we need to say this just as plainly as we possibly can: It\u2019s time to start arresting, prosecuting and imprisoning the violent, mindless mobs who are destroying the fabric of our society.\u000a\u000aFor all the talk of the \u201cpeaceful transition of power\u201d from Obama to Trump, there has been a transfer of power, alright, but it hasn\u2019t been very peaceful, as we\u2019ve seen. Indeed, there were protests in Washington and around the country the day after he was sworn into office, which is nearly unprecedented.\u000a\u000aAnd there are incidents cropping up all over the country like the one in the video above.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, as Trump attempts to heal the country while still trying to govern, there is abject and noticeable silence coming from Obama, Clinton, and every single Democrat in Congress \u2013 a tacit if not overt endorsement of the \u201cResist\u201d movement that has sprung up.\u000a\u000a\u201cPresident Obama is heartened by the level of engagement taking place in communities around the country,\u201d his spokesman, Kevin Lewis, said in a statement. \u201cIn his final official speech as president, he spoke about the important role of citizens and how all Americans have a responsibility to be the guardians of our democracy \u2014 not just during an election but every day.\u201d\u000a\u000aThis statement indicates that Obama, as was predicted, has already stepped into the fray to criticize Trump in a way his predecessor, George W. Bush, never did, and easily could have. This will only serve to further undermine Trump, as the discredited establishment press continues to treat Obama as though he\u2019s a president in abstention and, thus, relevant.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is entirely unprecedented in modern presidential politics and violates the unstated decorum that generally has governed the conduct of presidents after leaving office,\u201d Michael Johns, who served as a speechwriter in the administration of George H.W. Bush, told Lifezette. \u201cEverything Trump has done in the first week is truly consistent with what he promised he would do.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s all part of the strategy to be a consistent thorn in Trump\u2019s side, and to keep the angry Left angry, destructive and damaging to civil society. (RELATED: Keep current with how the Left threatens America at Bugout.news)\u000a\u000aWhen Americans are being attacked merely for expressing a political viewpoint \u2013 by people who justify it simply because it differs from their political viewpoint \u2013 the victims aren\u2019t the fascists and the Nazis, the attackers are.\u000a\u000aAt some point, there will be one attack too many, and the fuse will be lit. But before that happens, Trump can stop it. He has the means, as president, to bring law and order back to our country, and that may necessarily involve the invocation of some drastic measures like declaring a state of emergency and empowering local police and federal agencies to make mass arrests of people who are no longer merely \u201cprotesting,\u201d but who have become anarchists, craving and fomenting lawlessness, violence and destruction.\u000a\u000aWould a few months\u2019 worth of limited freedoms be a small price to pay to avoid the large-scale warfare and destruction that the Left seems determined to cause?\u000a\u000aMany Americans are beginning to think so.\u000a\u000aJ.D.

VIn a recent column for Breitbart News, the site\u2019s senior editor at large, Joel Pollack, lamented not simply the violence and destruction at UC-Berkeley, committed ostensibly in reaction to a planned event featuring Breitbart senior editor Milo Yiannopoulos, but also the \u201cofficial\u201d reaction, or rather non-reaction to it.\u000a\u000aFor instance, Pollack noted that Jesse Arreguin, the mayor of Berkeley, just another far-Left city in far-Left California, tweeted that Milo\u2019s \u201chate speech\u201d and as such would not be \u201cwelcome\u201d in the city. This tweet was accompanied by the familiar charges of \u201cbigotry\u201d and that the community would not tolerate being \u201cmarginalized\u201d by one man who has a different political viewpoint. A viewpoint, of course, he was unable to share on the intolerant Berkeley campus.\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s how the Left works: Its adherents self-define their political enemies, then use the same tactics they accuse the enemy of using to shut them down. And when they can\u2019t shame conservatives into silence, they attempt to beat or intimidate them into it. (RELATED: Conservatives won\u2019t be silenced and you can read all about it at Conservative.news)\u000a\u000aAbout that violence, it is also being accompanied by another familiar scene: That of local police standing idly by while innocent people are verbally and physically attacked. At Berkeley this week, one woman was sprayed with pepper spray; one man was beaten unconscious by domestic terrorists using steel rods.\u000a\u000aPolice response? As Pollack wrote:\u000a\u000aWere these groups merely showing up at events to protest \u2014 to express their views without silencing others \u2014 they would be perfectly entitled to do so. But lately, they have taken advantage of the timidity of the police \u2014 which they helped engineer, through their participation in the Black Lives Matter movement \u2014 to run amok, breaking up events and assaulting innocent people in full view of law enforcement officers and even the media. They are almost never pursued and never punished.\u000a\u000aHe noted further that the Berkeley newspaper, the Daily Californian, reported that just three people were arrested: Two in connection with violence they had committed earlier in the day and only one person at the protest, despite a night of injury, mayhem and property destruction.\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s absurd, and it\u2019s a travesty, quite frankly. As noted by The National Sentinel, at what point do innocents who are being victimized for attempting to exercise their First Amendment rights get to expect that police will protect them? Is it going to take more people being beaten? Is it going to take people being killed before cops will act? (RELATED: What has the insane Left done to academia today? Find out at CampusInsanity.com)\u000a\u000aBecause here\u2019s the problem we face, if this kind of Alt-Left violence is allowed to continue unchecked: Sooner or later, counter-groups will begin to show up at these events, ready to battle the Alt-Left terrorists. And what we\u2019ll have then is an all-out war in our streets and on our institutes of higher learning.\u000a\u000aIf these assaults were taking place outside the realm of a \u201cdemonstration\u201d the offenders would surely be arrested and charged with a crime. So what makes violence at political events any different, any less of an assault and battery? If anything, such politically motivated attacks ought to carry stiffer penalties because they are assaults on our constitutional founding.\u000a\u000aIs that what idiot mayors like Arreguin want?\u000a\u000aActually, yes. It\u2019s all part of the \u201crevolution\u201d \u2013 the far-Left movement to replace constitutional government with tyranny. Under the guise of \u2018fighting the good fight,\u2019 the angry Left is using the cover of political discourse to impose its will on the rest of the country, no matter what the results were of our last round of elections.\u000a\u000aBut at some point, the right will push back. It\u2019s inevitable; more Americans stand for the law and order that President Trump and conservatives represent than the violent despotism of the Left.\u000a\u000aIn a recent podcast, Natural News founder/editor Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, notes that what Milo is brilliantly doing is provoking Leftists into revealing who they really are: Insane, violent, anti-law, anti-free speech communist haters.

V(Natural News) A Chinese man\u2019s attempt to enter a zoo without paying the admission fee turned out to be a fatal mistake when the trespasser was mauled to death by tigers after jumping into their pen.\u000a\u000aThe husband and father of two was identified as a Mr. Zhang of Hubei province, who died of his injuries after being rushed to a hospital following the attack. Mr. Zhang was visiting the Youngor Zoo in the city of Ningbo in eastern China with his wife, two children, and a friend.\u000a\u000aZhang\u2019s wife and children reportedly paid the £15 entrance fee, while he and a friend attempted to scale the perimeter walls, one of which surrounded the tiger pen. In front of horrified onlookers \u2013 which reportedly included Zhang\u2019s wife and kids \u2013 Zhang jumped into the tiger pen, but his friend did not follow.\u000a\u000aFrom the BBC:\u000a\u000a\u201cIt said that Mr Zhang, along with his wife and two children, were visiting the park on Sunday with his colleague, surnamed Li, and his wife.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe women and children had bought tickets and entered the park, but the two men decided to scale the zoo\u2019s 3m-tall (10ft) outer wall, said Mr. Li who gave a statement to the tourism authority.\u000a\u000a\u201cThey then climbed another 3m-tall wall that was the boundary of the tiger enclosure. Mr Zhang dropped down into the enclosure and was attacked by a tiger, said Mr Li, who did not follow.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe tourism authority said there were prominent warning signs posted around the point the two men had entered the park, and iron fencing on top of the walls.\u201d\u000a\u000aMembers of the crowd took photographs and video of the grisly incident, including photos of Zhang on top of the wall before entering the enclosure, as well as footage of part of the actual attack, which is posted below:\u000a\u000aWARNING: video includes graphic content that may not be suitable for some viewers.\u000a\u000aIn the video, Zhang can be seen surrounded by what appear to be three Siberian tigers, one of which proceeds to bite and claw the victim while repeatedly preventing him from escaping. The screams of onlookers can be heard in the background.\u000a\u000aOne of the tigers reportedly attempted to drag the bloody man\u2019s body into the brush, before zoo officials used firecrackers and water cannons in an unsuccessful attempt to scare away the animals. The tiger that refused to release Zhang\u2019s body was finally shot and killed.\u000a\u000aThe incident has been a hot topic on Chinese social media, with many defending the tigers and placing the blame solely on a man who \u201creally does not deserve sympathy,\u201d as one commentator put it.\u000a\u000aStrangely enough, these sort of cases seem to have been common lately, particularly in China. In July of last year, tigers mauled two women at a wildlife park in Beijing, killing one and injuring the other.\u000a\u000aThe attack occurred when the two women left their vehicle while visiting Beijing Badaling Wildlife World, a wild animal park where visitors are allowed to drive their cars but are instructed not to get out of them.\u000a\u000aA video of that incident shows the first woman leaving the car before soon being attacked and dragged away by a tiger. A second woman \u2013 the mother of the first woman \u2013 leaves the car in an attempt to rescue her daughter but is killed by another tiger. A man who remained in the car was unhurt. An argument was reportedly the reason the first woman left the car.\u000a\u000aIt certainly is tragic when wild animals must be killed in cases like this \u2013 instances where humans who should have known better were responsible for creating a danger to themselves and unfortunately, innocent animals as well.\u000a\u000aThis, folks, is the reason we have the Darwin Awards.

V(Natural News) According to a study by the British think tank, Reform, robots could potentially replace 90 percent of federal workers, a transition that would save the government an estimated $8 billion per year.\u000a\u000aThe study indicates that robots would be much more efficient than humans when it comes to data collection, processing paperwork and other routine tasks. Even professions that require more skill and precision, such as jobs in the medical field, could benefit from robotic assistants doing odds and ends around the workplace. (RELATED: Learn about new technology from Amazon that could take over 3 million human jobs).\u000a\u000aReform found that there are actually very few jobs in civil service that absolutely require a human being as opposed to a robot. \u201cTwenty percent of public-sector workers hold \u2018strategic,\u2019 cognitive roles,\u201d Reform said in their press release on the study. \u201cThey will use data analytics to identify patterns\u2014improving decision-making and allocating workers most efficiently.\u201d\u000a\u000aA similar study out of Oxford University drew the same conclusions as Reform. They found that more than 850,000 public sector jobs could be taken over by robots sometime within the next 10 years. Reform suggests that federal workers consider taking advantage of job opportunities that at least right now are exclusively for humans, like driving for Uber. (RELATED: Read about another study that says robots will replace 5 million human jobs by 2020).\u000a\u000aIn America, robots are already replacing thousands of jobs that for decades were exclusively handled by human beings. In Silicon Valley, California, shopping malls are beginning to replace security guards with robots capable of detecting suspicious behavior and even listening for potential criminal activity.\u000a\u000aJournalists aren\u2019t safe from this robot takeover either. The U.S. tech company, Narrative Science, has created software called Quill, which has the ability to collect and analyze raw data and transform it into complete, coherent reports and essays. Both Forbes and the Associated Press have used Quill for corporate earning reports and for financial and sports reports, respectively.\u000a\u000aRecently, the UCSF Medical Center developed and launched a robotics-controlled pharmacy at two UCSF hospitals. Computers at the pharmacies receive specific information on medication orders, and automated robots pick and package specific quantities of pills for the consumer. The pills are placed into a plastic ring that contains all of the necessary medications for the patient to cover a 12-hour period. So far, the robots have prepared and delivered 350,000 doses of medication without any errors.\u000a\u000aBut perhaps the most impressive examples of robot technology in the workplace are found in the fast food industry, where burgers are being flipped and drinks are being poured all with minimal human assistance, or none at all. Five years ago in San Francisco, a robotics company called Momentum Machines demonstrated how one of their machines was capable of producing 400 hamburgers in just one hour. From the slicing of the onion to the frying of the beef patty, the robot was able to assemble the entire burger all on its own.\u000a\u000aNow, Momentum Machines has applied for a permit to construct its own restaurant in the heart of San Francisco, which is expected to utilize the same incredible technology that the company debuted in 2012. According to an ad posted by Momentum Machines on Craigslist, \u201cThis location will feature the world-premiere of our proprietary and remarkable new advances in technology that enable the automatic creation of impossibly delicious burgers at prices everyone can afford.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe world is not the same place that it was 50, 25 or even 10 years ago. Whether in Britain or the United States, technology is rapidly advancing and being introduced into the workforce as a means of cutting costs and increasing efficiency. Humans will have to learn how to live with these new robotic companions, for better or for worse.\u000a\u000aFollow more news on robotics at Robotics.news.\u000a\u000aSources\u000a\u000aZeroHedge.com\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aMSN.com\u000a\u000aBusinessInsider.com\u000a\u000aNBCNews.com

Both Forbes and the Associated Press have used Quill for corporate earning reports and for financial and sports reports, respectively.</p>\u000a<p>Recently, the UCSF Medical Center developed and launched a robotics-controlled pharmacy at two UCSF hospitals. Computers at the pharmacies receive specific information on medication orders, and automated robots pick and package specific quantities of pills for the consumer. The pills are placed into a plastic ring that contains all of the necessary medications for the patient to cover a 12-hour period. So far, the robots have prepared and delivered 350,000 doses of medication without any errors.</p>\u000a<p>But perhaps the most impressive examples of robot technology in the workplace are found in the fast food industry, where burgers are being flipped and drinks are being poured all with minimal human assistance, or none at all. Five years ago in San Francisco, a robotics company called Momentum Machines demonstrated how one of their machines was capable of producing 400 hamburgers in just one hour. From the slicing of the onion to the frying of the beef patty, the <a href="http://www.robotsrisingnews.com/">robot was able to assemble the entire burger all on its own</a>.</p>\u000a<p>Now, Momentum Machines has applied for a permit to construct its own restaurant in the heart of San Francisco, which is expected to utilize the same incredible technology that the company debuted in 2012. According to an ad posted by Momentum Machines on Craigslist, &#8220;This location will feature the world-premiere of our proprietary and remarkable new advances in technology that enable the automatic creation of impossibly delicious burgers at prices everyone can afford.&#8221;</p>\u000a<p>The world is not the same place that it was 50, 25&#160;or even 10 years ago. Whether in Britain or the United States, technology is rapidly advancing and being introduced into the workforce as a means of cutting costs and increasing efficiency. Humans will have to learn how to live with these new robotic companions, for better or for worse.</p>\u000a<p>Follow more <a href="http://robotics.news" target="_blank">news on robotics at Robotics.news</a>.</p>\u000a<p><strong>Sources</strong></p>\u000a<p><a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-02-08/most-government-workers-could-be-replaced-robots-new-study-finds">ZeroHedge.com<br>\u000a</a></p>\u000a<p><a href="http://www.msn.com/en-us/money/careersandeducation/21-jobs-where-robots-are-already-replacing-humans/ss-BBv6yiU#image=11">MSN.com</a></p>\u000a<p><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/momentum-machines-is-hiring-2016-6">BusinessInsider.com</a></p>\u000a<p><a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/42183592/ns/business-careers/t/nine-jobs-humans-may-lose-robots/#.WJ6RtRIrKRs">NBCNews.com</a></p>\u000a \u000a</div>

V(Natural News) The establishment has been moving towards a cashless society, and they are in the process of stepping up their game. The European Union (EU) is devising a plan to limit cash transactions with the intended goal of ending anonymous transactions. This is a war against privacy, freedom and human rights.\u000a\u000aThe new proposal will seek to ban anonymous transactions over a certain value, but that value has yet to be specified. The proposal explores several options for ending economic privacy, but the ultimate goal on the agenda is to ban cash outright. A cashless society would have major implications and serve as a massive tax grab. Statistics from a recent Gallup poll show that nearly one-quarter of Americans make the majority of their purchases with cash.\u000a\u000aThe cash ban agenda is underway in Europe, where some countries have imposed cash spending limits as low as 1,000 euro. Additionally, the European central bank has announced that it will stop manufacturing high-value notes. This is another ramification of the war on terror being a war on society and freedom. Efforts to ban cash are being disguised as efforts to fight terrorism. In reality, studies show that countries with higher value currency denominations have less terror and crime than those which only have smaller denominations available.\u000a\u000aAnother reasoning for the cash ban includes stealing money from savings accounts with negative interest rates. Globalists want all the money to be accounted for so that they can tax it, track it or flat out confiscate it. Negative interest rates have already been implemented in portions of Europe. Several individual member states of the European Union have already passed legislation pushing the move away from cash.

V(Natural News) Now for something completely different\u2026\u000a\u000aAs our world become ever more strange by the day, numerous UFO experts are warning about what might be the most bizarre event in human history: A \u201ccosmic false flag\u201d where, they claim, desperate governments of the world stage a massive fake alien invasion to finally complete their goal of ensuring total human obedience under a never-ending \u201cthe aliens are coming\u201d false hysteria. It may sound crazy to the uninitiated, but listen to the experts below before making up your mind, and check out the Washington Post\u2019s coverage of some of the technology that can help make this happen (link below).\u000a\u000aSuch an event, the experts say, could be pulled off by a combination of advanced human-made exotic aircraft, advanced holographic technology and a complicit global media already practiced in the art of engineering elaborate fake news (CNN, Washington Post, etc.) to propagandize gullible viewers. Truth be told, most humans believe whatever they\u2019re told to believe, even it\u2019s based on no supportable evidence whatsoever (case in point: the global climate change hoax).\u000a\u000a(Note from Adams: Based on what I\u2019ve seen from humanity so far, people don\u2019t even need holograms to fall for a false flag. Most people will literally hallucinate whatever images the mainstream media is trying to put into their heads, literally fabricating false visual memories to fit the narrative they\u2019ve been exposed to in the controlled media.)\u000a\u000aDr. Stephen Greer of Sirius Disclosure\u000a\u000aOne of the best known researchers who speaks publicly about a \u201ccosmic false flag\u201d event is Dr. Stephen Greer of Sirius Disclosure, an organization dedicated to unveiling the truth about real extraterrestrials as well as organized human hoaxes intended to trick the masses.\u000a\u000aAccording to Dr. Greer, many (but not all) of the so-called \u201cUFO\u201d events being witnessed around the world involve craft that are manufactured by humans. He furthermore asserts that the \u201cmilitary industrial complex\u201d consists of a power structure far beyond the reach of even the U.S. President, and that such interests are planning a \u201ccosmic false flag\u201d event to trick humanity into thinking an alien invasion is taking place. (RELATED: Follow news and discussions about UFO events at UFOs.news.)\u000a\u000aSee his full lecture here (story continues below):\u000a\u000aCLAIM: A global power structure will pursue the radical depopulation of the planet in the very near future via \u201cscripted Armageddon\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAccording to Dr. Greer, if people across the planet become too awakened and start to challenge the status quo power structure, an \u201calien invasion\u201d will be staged through the deployment of convincing \u201calien\u201d aircraft that have actually been developed, tested and perfected by secretive weapons companies like Northrup, Grumman and Boeing. With the help of the fakestream media \u2014 CNN, NYT, WashPost and other presstitutes \u2014 any narrative can then be pushed as \u201cfact.\u201d\u000a\u000aNow that a mass global awakening is accelerating by the day, the staging of this \u201ccosmic false flag\u201d seems imminent, warn researchers.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf someone tries to stage an event, we\u2019re all going to call it out as the hoax that it is\u2026 and not go along with that what I\u2019m calling \u2018scripted Armageddon.'\u201d says Greer. He explains that the \u201ccosmic false flag\u201d may be the cover story to engage in a partial extermination of humanity:\u000a\u000aThey would love to see a shut down of our civilization and the extermination of about five billion people, through a conflict that they will stage, and they will manufacture Armageddon. And that\u2019s the big deep plan that has been in place since the 50s. Those people in the intelligence community who know of this\u2026 I can\u2019t even put in words the extent to which they are devastated when they learn this. Because they know how these folks are utilizing religiosity, racism, alienism, division to keep the fire burning. But the big one is going to be the launch of a hoaxed attack on the planet that would look 100% like an extraterrestrial event\u2026 and it is not.\u000a\u000aThe technology already exists to pull it off\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe technology already exists to carry out a massive fake alien attack that can convince most people of its authenticity. As the Mark Dice video explains below, the Washington Post even ran a story in 1999 detailing how the U.S. military planned to stage an \u201cappearance of God\u201d in Iraq in order to make the people there fall into line.\u000a\u000aThat WashPo story, which also describes how the U.S. military was able to perfectly fake the voice of any person saying anything they wanted, is still published at this link.\u000a\u000aNote that this technology already existed in 1999. It is now 18 years later. Imagine the applications for a massive \u201ccosmic false flag\u201d roll out that fakes the voice of Donald Trump\u2026\u000a\u000aThe false flag \u201calien attack\u201d can also be augmented, other experts say, by present-day audio projection technology that can literally project full human speech (and other sounds) into the heads of large groups of people. It\u2019s called a \u201cradio frequency hearing effect.\u201d Search for it on GoodGopher.com at this link to learn more.

VIt is obvious by now that the Washington bureaucracy that President Donald Trump and his team inherited from former President Obama is basically an opposition party, replete with faceless individuals who have pledged to undermine him at every opportunity.\u000a\u000aThat became obvious when transcripts of phone conversations Trump had with certain world leaders were leaked to the Democratic Party\u2019s propaganda wing, the establishment media.\u000a\u000aIn the first case, a transcript of Trump\u2019s conversation with the Mexican president, Eduardo Peta Nieto, was leaked, but was done in such a way as to clearly misrepresent the context. As noted by The Associated Press, Trump allegedly threatened U.S. military intervention into Mexico in order to take care of \u201cbad hombres\u201d if that country couldn\u2019t do it. It wasn\u2019t clear who Trump meant when he referred to bad hombres, but you can take your guess \u2013 it\u2019s likely to mean the drug cartels, the human smugglers, or both. (RELATED: Find out how they\u2019re fooling us today at Hoax.news)\u000a\u000aBut then the AP went on to note that Mexican officials denied there was ever any seriousness to Trump\u2019s \u201cthreat,\u201d and in fact, they reported just the opposite:\u000a\u000aEduardo Sanchez, spokesman for Mexico\u2019s presidential office, denied the tone of the conversation was hostile or humiliating, saying it was respectful.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is absolutely false that the president of the United States threatened to send troops to Mexico,\u201d Sanchez said in an interview with Radio Formula on Wednesday night.\u000a\u000aThe transcript of another call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull had discussions ending abruptly after Trump discovered that Obama had made a lousy deal with the land Down Under to take at least some of the many Muslim refugees they were detaining from Indonesia and elsewhere (Australians of all political stripes have seen what is happening in the U.S. and Europe and want no part of the problems attributed to the mass migration of Muslims from the Middle East).\u000a\u000aIn any event, after these two incidents, the president wants the leaks tracked down. As Sean Spicer, White House spokesman, in a transcript obtained by Reuters, told Fox News, \u201cThe president takes these leaks very seriously.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThat\u2019s troubling and I think the president has asked the team to look into this because those are very serious implications,\u201d he said, adding that calls were \u201ccandid\u201d but respectful, and that even the two governments were refuting some of what\u2019s been reported.\u000a\u000aAs The National Sentinel noted in reporting on the leaks:\u000a\u000aOkay, so it\u2019s obvious that there are elements within our government that are hostile to the current administration. \u2026\u000a\u000aThese kinds of attempts at sabotaging the Trump presidency will not go away, and in fact, you should probably count on them getting even more intense as our billionaire president seeks to fulfill his campaign pledge to \u201cdrain the swamp.\u201d The swamp\u2019s inhabitants \u2013 in the Congress, in the bureaucracy and in the donor class \u2013 are not going to simply go away quietly.\u000a\u000aThe only way to prevent further sabotage in the future is to dramatically reduce the amount of bureaucracy \u2013 as in, get rid of many of the careerists who are dead-set against this president primarily for the reason that he wants to eliminate their jobs. (RELATED: Trump is dedicated to cutting red tape and bureaucracy \u2013 learn more at BigGovernment.news)\u000a\u000aBeyond that, careerist bureaucrats \u2013 particularly in the State Department, which is inhabited by Left-wing Ivy League foreign policy types who have a very liberal worldview and a certain way of doing things \u2013 simply do not share Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica first\u201d vision. And they certainly don\u2019t appreciate the manner in which he gets things done. They, like the rest of the political and media establishment, have never seen or met or had to deal with any U.S. president like Trump, and probably never will again.\u000a\u000aThat aside, their job is to serve the American people by serving the president, who was duly elected. In the meantime, Trump is likely to keep some staffers extremely busy hunting down those who leaked the intimate details of his government. These won\u2019t be the last leaks.\u000a\u000aJ.D.

VInfluenza (flu) season is here. The media and CDC have been heavily pushing the influenza vaccine for over a month already. However, research has shown that this year\u2019s flu shot is extremely toxic, ineffective and unsafe! Did you know that the 2013-2014 influenza vaccines contain dangerous levels of mercury? The vaccine contains 25,000 times more mercury than the safety limit for drinking water! Did you know that infant and pediatric flu deaths were on the decline until 2003 when the pediatric influenza vaccine was introduced? After that, the pediatric death rate skyrocketed! Before you choose to vaccinate yourself and your children, get the facts about the influenza vaccine.\u000a\u000aI have recently written several articles on the problems and dangers of the flu shot. Read here about why the flu shot is more dangerous than the flu. You can also read here about how the media-reported flu deaths have been hyped up in order to scare people into the flu shot. Healthcare decisions, in general, can be complicated. The vaccine decision is even more complicated due to the vast amount of conflicting information. Before you make these decisions, I urge to move past the hype and get the facts!\u000a\u000aMost importantly, you must know that your body is intelligently designed to fight the hundreds of influenza viruses that cause the flu. Your immune system is amazingly well equipped to help you prevent colds, flu and even cancer. Developing a flu-proof immune system is an essential part of your health plan this year. You can stay well! Even if you do get sick, you can overcome the flu and heal.\u000a\u000aThis astounding report was written by Mary Tocco, independent vaccine investigator. She reveals the truth about this years influenza vaccines and the facts that the pharmaceutical industry and the CDC do not want you to know. This is information provides facts not hype. It is exactly what you need in order to confidently make your decision about the influenza vaccine.\u000a\u000aInfluenza Vaccine Facts They Don\u2019t Want You to Know!\u000a\u000aUpdated: September 5, 2013\u000a\u000aMary Tocco\u000a\u000aThe 2013-2014 Influenza vaccines have been approved for use and will contain Thimerosal (Hg, mercury) and are recommended for every child, adult and pregnant mother. Here are the 5 different influenza vaccines:\u000a\u000aTrivalent Vaccines Afluria® 5.0 mL multi-dose vial\u2014one 0.5mL jab will contain 24.5 \u03bcg Hg\u000a\u000aFluLaval® 5.0 mL multi-dose vial\u2014one 0.5 mL jab will contain less than 25\u03bcg Hg\u000a\u000aFluvirin® 0.5 mL one dose prefilled syringe will contain \u2264 1 \u03bcg Hg 5.0 mL multi-dose vial\u2014one 0.5 mL jab will contain 25 \u03bcg Hg\u000a\u000aFluzone® 5.0 mL multi-dose vial\u2014one 0.5 mL jab will contain 25 \u03bcg Hg\u000a\u000aFluLaval® Quadrivalent 5.0 mL multi-dose vial\u2014one jab will contain 25 \u03bcg Hg\u000a\u000aPlease keep in mind that one (1) microgram (\u03bcg) equals 0.0010 milligram (mg). Often physicians refer to the \u201ctrace\u201d of thimerosal as safe and even healthy! The way to compare what a trace is in a vaccine is to compare to what is considered safe and allowable in our environment: water, liquids and foods we eat and compare the levels in the vaccines they encourage us to inject.\u000a\u000a2 ppb (parts-per-billion) is the mandated safeyt limit in drinking water\u000a\u000a200 ppb of mercury in liquid waste renders it a toxic hazard and must be treated as such\u000a\u000a730-1400 ppb is EPA safe allowable limit in fish (we ingest)\u000a\u000a 25,000 ppb may be found in the infant flu vaccine (injected)\u000a\u000a50,000 ppb found in regular flu vaccine recommended for children, pregnant mothers and adults (injected)\u000a\u000aBoyd Haley, Professor and Chair, Dept. of Chemistry, University Kentucky and mercury specialist in 2001 was responding to the statement that the mercury in vaccines is safe and he said the following, \u201cA single vaccine given to a 6 pound newborn (containing thimerosal) is the equivalent of giving a 180-pound adult 30 vaccinations on the same day.\u201d\u000a\u000aFact #1: Over 200 viruses can cause influenza and influenza-like illness which produce the same or similar symptoms. Unless you have laboratory tests, doctors cannot tell the illnesses apart. All these related illnesses can last for days and rarely lead to death or serious illness unless a person is immune compromised. Vaccines usually contain only three (3) viruses that were chosen to be included in vaccines many months before a flu season begins, so it is a guessing game as to which flu strain will actually occur.\u000a\u000aFact #2: Currently, there are no studies tracking people who get the vaccine and get sick with flu symptoms or other reactions including death, which should be made for proper disease diagnosis, data collecting and controls. When reported to doctors, people are told that they can\u2019t catch the flu from the vaccine. I personally have had hundreds of people share their stories with me including stories about people who have died following the vaccine. Stories of paralysis, narcolepsy and febrile convulsions, neurological problems and pregnancy miscarriages are common. Nurses who work in the hospitals are witness to the numbers of people who come in to the emergency room very ill after the influenza vaccines.\u000a\u000aFact #3: Death rates from influenza are combined with people who are immune compromised and actually die with pneumonia, a complication of contracting influenza.\u000a\u000aFact #4: Prior to implementing the pediatric flu vaccine in 2003, pediatric deaths from influenza were decreasing. The CDC recommended universal influenza vaccines for children in 2003. According to the Center for Disease Vital Statistics and the MMWR Annual Report, deaths have increased, indicating flu vaccines are not as effective as advertised:\u000a\u000a1999 \u2013 25 deaths\u000a\u000a2000 \u2013 19 deaths\u000a\u000a2001 \u2013 13 deaths\u000a\u000a2002 \u2013 12 deaths\u000a\u000a2003 \u2013 90 deaths (Year of mass vaccinations of children under age 5 years)\u000a\u000a2006 \u2013 78 deaths\u000a\u000a2007 \u2013 88 deaths\u000a\u000a2008 \u2013 116 deaths (40.9% vaccinated at age 6 months to 23 months)\u000a\u000a2009 \u2013 276 deaths\u000a\u000a2010 \u2013 115 deaths\u000a\u000aNeil Z. Miller, Vaccine Safety Manual For Concerned Families and Health Practitioners (New Atlantean Press) pg. 97 (Years 199-2003) References: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report \u2013 CDC Sept. 16, 2011 \u201cCopyright Neil Z. Miller- Vaccine Safety Manual (New Atlantean Press)\u201d\u000a\u000aFact #5: Influenza death rates are greatly exaggerated at the beginning of each flu season to drive people to get the vaccines. The common figure of 35,000 deaths per year is not true and has not been the true number for many years. A more accurate figure is closer to 20, 000 deaths per year nationally from influenza, and majority of time it is people who are immune compromised with other chronic/acute illnesses. The main reason for death is pneumonia, not the flu but the statistics are blended together to make it appear worse than it is. In the book, Vaccine Safety Manual (pg. 97) by Neil Z. Miller, he carefully examined the true statistics published in the Mortality Morbidity Weekly Report and found the actual deaths from pediatric influenza as noted above years 1999-2003.\u000a\u000aFact #6: National Coalition of Organized Women studied the numbers of pregnancy miscarriages following the H1N1 2009-2010 influenza vaccine program and found a 20-plus-fold increase in miscarriages compared to the previous flu-vaccine-associated-miscarriages in 2007-2008 and 2008-2009 flu season. The H1N1 influenza vaccine contains thimerosal, a form of ethylmercury that was supposed to be removed from all vaccines after Congressional Hearings. (Government Reform Committee Hearings on Autism and Vaccines 2000-2003) Thimerosal is in all multi-dose vaccine vials.\u000a\u000aFact #7: When children die of influenza, they never look to see if that child was fully vaccinated (normal childhood vaccinations) previously resulting in immune suppression or compromise or if they had just received the influenza vaccine. The media uses a few unfortunate deaths to scare people into getting the flu vaccines. They also reference \u201cpandemic\u201d when in fact the numbers are low and do not qualify as a true pandemic, whose definition was changed by the World Health Organization (WHO in 2009).\u000a\u000aReference: http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/statements/2009/h1n1_pandemic_phase6_20090611/en/index.html\u000a\u000aThis was exactly what happened in the 2009-2010 world-wide influenza H1N1 season.\u000a\u000aFact #8: We were told the lie by the government that the H1N1 virus was a \u201cnever before seen virus\u201d in 2009-2010 fake pandemic year. Pharmaceutical companies have been producing influenza vaccines for many years and have been giving people the H1N1 virus since 2006-2007 in 2 vaccines:\u000a\u000a(1) Fluvirin® Purified Surface Antigen Vaccine, Trivalent, Types A and B Manufacturer Chiron Corp.

They are combining viruses that would never show up in nature. This is what I refer to as \u201cFrankenScience\u201d and is extremely dangerous. By introducing these to the world, they are assuring some crazy outbreak eventually as people\u2019s immune systems malfunction.\u000a\u000aInfluenza: Evidence from Cochrane Reviews\u000a\u000aThe Cochrane Reviews have summarized data about the benefits and harms of several interventions for preventing and treating influenza. These comprehensive reviews provide valuable information for patients, doctors, and healthcare decision-makers. I encourage people to pull it off the Internet and read the entire review but here are some of the highlights of the report exposing the lack of safety and lack of effectiveness.\u000a\u000aViral epidemics or pandemics of acute respiratory infections like influenza or severe acute respiratory syndrome pose a world-wide threat. Antiviral drugs and vaccinations may be insufficient to prevent catastrophe. This review assesses the effectiveness of physical interventions, such as hand-washing or wearing masks, to interrupt or reduce the spread of respiratory viruses.\u000a\u000aPreventing influenza: drugs, including neuraminidase inhibitors (e.g. Relenza and Tamiflu) Amantadine and rimantadine for influenza A in children and the elderly. Although amantadine and rimantadine are used to relieve or treat influenza A symptoms in healthy adults, little is known about the effectiveness and safety of these antivirals in preventing and treating influenza A in children and the elderly.\u000a\u000aPreventing influenza: vaccines for healthy people: The consequences of influenza in children and adults are mainly absenteeism from school and work.\u000a\u000aWe included 75 studies with about 300,000 observations. We included 17 RCTs, 19 cohort studies and 11 case-control studies in the analysis of vaccine efficacy and effectiveness. Evidence from RCTs shows that six children under the age of six need to be vaccinated with live attenuated vaccine to prevent one case of influenza (infection and symptoms). We could find no usable data for those aged two years or younger.\u000a\u000aInactivated vaccines in children aged two years or younger are not significantly more efficacious than placebo. Twenty-eight children over the age of six need to be vaccinated to prevent one case of influenza (infection and symptoms). Eight need to be vaccinated to prevent one case of influenza-like-illness (ILI). We could find no evidence of effect on secondary cases, lower respiratory tract disease, drug prescriptions, otitis media and its consequences and socioeconomic impact.\u000a\u000aWe found weak single-study evidence of effect on school absenteeism by children and caring parents from work. Extensive evidence of reporting bias of safety outcomes from trials of live attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIVs) impeded meaningful analysis. One specific brand of monovalent pandemic vaccine is associated with cataplexy and narcolepsy in children and there is sparse evidence of serious harms (such as febrile convulsions) in specific situations.\u000a\u000aConclusions: Influenza vaccines are efficacious in preventing cases of influenza in children older than two years of age, but little evidence is available for children younger than two years of age. There was a difference between vaccine efficacy and effectiveness, partly due to differing datasets, settings and viral circulation patterns. No safety comparisons could be carried out, emphasizing the need for standardization of methods and presentation of vaccine safety data in future studies. In specific cases, influenza vaccines were associated with serious harms such as narcolepsy and febrile convulsions. It was surprising to find only one study of inactivated vaccine in children under two years, given current recommendations to vaccinate healthy children from six months of age in the USA, Canada, parts of Europe and Australia. If immunization in children is to be recommended as a public health policy, large-scale studies assessing important outcomes, and directly comparing vaccine types are urgently required.\u000a\u000aInfluenza Manufacturer\u2019s Package Inserts Admit the Following:\u000a\u000a\u201cThere are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response\u201d.\u000a\u000aAnimal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Fluzone or Fluzone High-Dose.

I encourage people to learn all they can about the role of natural immunity through natural exposure to infectious illnesses, plus proper nutrition and supplementation to enhance the immune system. Credit is being given to vaccines for improving the health of people across the globe and this researcher feels that there are many other influences that need to be considered.

V<div><p>Influenza (flu) season is here. The media and CDC have been heavily pushing the influenza vaccine for over a month already. However, research has shown that this year&#8217;s&#160;<a title="20 Reasons Why The Flu Shot Is More Dangerous Than The Flu" href="http://wellnessachiever.net/flu-shot-more-dangerous-than-flu/" target="_blank">flu shot</a>&#160;is extremely toxic, ineffective and unsafe! Did you know that the 2013-2014 influenza vaccines contain&#160;<strong>dangerous levels of mercury</strong>? The vaccine contains&#160;<strong>25,000</strong>&#160;times more mercury than the safety limit for drinking water! Did you know that infant and pediatric flu deaths were on the decline&#160;<strong>until</strong>&#160;2003 when the pediatric influenza vaccine was introduced? After that, the pediatric death rate skyrocketed! Before you choose to vaccinate yourself and your children, get the facts about the influenza vaccine.</p>\u000a<p>I have recently written several articles on the problems and dangers of the flu shot.

She reveals the truth about this years influenza vaccines and the facts that the pharmaceutical industry and the CDC do not want you to know. This is information provides facts not hype. It is exactly what you need in order to confidently make your decision about the influenza vaccine.</p>\u000a<h1>Influenza Vaccine Facts They Don&#8217;t Want You to Know!</h1>\u000a<p dir="ltr">Updated: &#160;September 5, 2013</p>\u000a<p dir="ltr">Mary Tocco</p>\u000a<p dir="ltr">The&#160;<strong>2013-2014</strong>&#160;Influenza vaccines have been approved for use and will contain Thimerosal (<strong>Hg, mercury</strong>) and are recommended for every child, adult and pregnant mother. Here are the 5 different influenza vaccines:</p>\u000a<ul>\u000a<li>\u000a<p dir="ltr">Trivalent Vaccines Afluria&#174; 5.0 mL multi-dose vial&#8212;one 0.5mL jab will contain <strong>24.5 &#956;g Hg</strong></p>\u000a</li>\u000a<li>\u000a<p dir="ltr">FluLaval&#174; 5.0 mL multi-dose vial&#8212;one 0.5 mL jab will contain less than <strong>25&#956;g Hg</strong></p>\u000a</li>\u000a<li>\u000a<p dir="ltr">Fluvirin&#174; 0.5 mL one dose prefilled syringe will contain &#8804; 1 &#956;g Hg 5.0 mL multi-dose vial&#8212;one 0.5 mL jab will contain <strong>25 &#956;g Hg</strong></p>\u000a</li>\u000a<li>\u000a<p dir="ltr">Fluzone&#174; 5.0 mL multi-dose vial&#8212;one 0.5 mL jab will contain <strong>25 &#956;g Hg</strong></p>\u000a</li>\u000a<li>\u000a<p dir="ltr">FluLaval&#174; Quadrivalent 5.0 mL multi-dose vial&#8212;one jab will contain <strong>25 &#956;g Hg</strong></p>\u000a</li>\u000a</ul>\u000a<p dir="ltr">Please keep in mind that one (1) microgram (&#956;g) equals 0.0010 milligram (mg). Often physicians refer to the &#8220;trace&#8221; of thimerosal as safe and even healthy! The way to compare what a trace is in a vaccine is to compare to what is considered safe and allowable in our environment: water, liquids and foods we eat and compare the levels in the vaccines they encourage us to inject.</p>\u000a<ul>\u000a<li>\u000a<p dir="ltr">2 ppb (parts-per-billion) is the mandated safeyt limit in drinking water</p>\u000a</li>\u000a<li>\u000a<p dir="ltr">200 &#160;ppb of mercury in liquid waste renders it a toxic hazard and must be treated as such</p>\u000a</li>\u000a<li>\u000a<p dir="ltr">&#151;730-1400 ppb is EPA safe allowable limit in fish (we ingest)</p>\u000a</li>\u000a<li>\u000a<p dir="ltr">&#151;<strong>25,000</strong>&#160;ppb may be found in the infant flu vaccine (injected)</p>\u000a</li>\u000a<li>\u000a<p dir="ltr"><strong>50,000</strong>&#160;ppb found in regular flu vaccine recommended for children, pregnant mothers and adults (injected)</p>\u000a</li>\u000a</ul>\u000a<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.chem.uky.edu/research/haley/" target="_blank">Boyd Haley</a>, Professor and Chair, Dept. of Chemistry, University Kentucky and&#160;<a href="http://www.mercuryexposure.info/home/about/itemlist/user/182-boydhaley" target="_blank">mercury specialist</a>&#160;in 2001 was responding to the statement that the mercury in vaccines is safe and he said the following, &#8220;A single vaccine given to a 6 pound newborn (containing thimerosal) is the equivalent of giving a 180-pound adult 30 vaccinations on the same day.&#8221;</p>\u000a<p dir="ltr"><strong>Fact #1:</strong>&#160;Over&#160;<strong>200</strong>&#160;viruses can cause influenza and influenza-like illness which produce the same or similar symptoms. Unless you have laboratory tests, doctors cannot tell the illnesses apart. All these related illnesses can last for days and rarely lead to death or serious illness unless a person is immune compromised. Vaccines usually contain<strong>&#160;only three (3)</strong>&#160;viruses that were chosen to be included in vaccines many months before a flu season begins, so it is a guessing game as to which flu strain will actually occur.</p>\u000a<p dir="ltr"><strong>Fact #2:</strong>&#160;Currently, there are no studies tracking people who get the vaccine and get sick with flu symptoms or other reactions including death, which should be made for proper disease diagnosis, data collecting and controls. When reported to doctors, people are told that they can&#8217;t catch the flu from the vaccine. I personally have had hundreds of people share their stories with me including stories about people who have died following the vaccine. Stories of paralysis, narcolepsy and febrile convulsions, neurological problems and pregnancy miscarriages are common. Nurses who work in the hospitals are witness to the numbers of people who come in to the emergency room very ill after the influenza vaccines.</p>\u000a<p dir="ltr"><strong>Fact #3:</strong>&#160;Death rates from influenza are combined with people who are immune compromised and actually die with pneumonia, a complication of contracting influenza.</p>\u000a<p dir="ltr"><strong>Fact #4:</strong>&#160;Prior to implementing the pediatric flu vaccine in 2003, pediatric deaths from influenza were decreasing. The CDC recommended universal influenza vaccines for children in 2003.

The common figure of 35,000 deaths per year is not true and has not been the true number for many years.

The H1N1 influenza vaccine contains thimerosal, a form of ethylmercury that was supposed to be removed from all vaccines after Congressional Hearings.

VThe leading cause of cancer is the food we eat. A long time ago we consumed a diet of mainly alkaline food, but that has changed, and rate of cancer has increased. The majority doctors don\u2019t inform you on the correct food to eat to stay free of cancer and what to eat to cause the body to remove it naturally.\u000a\u000aThe Foods we eat in today\u2019s time contain both acid and alkalinizing forming elements. A diet of mainly acid-forming food can contribute to cancer. Unfortunately, that is a common diet here in the western culture. American\u2019s diet today is mostly acidic. If you are fighting cancer, you need to balance the body\u2019s pH level because cancer will thrive in an acidic environment whereas an alkaline environment will remove cancer.\u000a\u000aWe see more people with cancer today more than ever before, and it\u2019s because the typical western diet is far too high in acid-producing foods such as animal products which include dairy products.\u000a\u000aThe foods we used to eat like freshly grown fruit and vegetables were much better for us, so the best solution is to make some dietary changes. The alkaline-acid ratio is measured on the pH scale which ranges from 0 to 14 with 7 being neutral. The lower end of the scale which is from 0 to 7 is acidic, and anything between 7 to 14 is alkaline.\u000a\u000aThe easiest way to find out what foods are either alkaline or acidic is to research which foods are alkaline or acidic more so than others, also test your alkaline level often. While a diagnosis of cancer may have other contributing factors, the food we eat now is the main cause.\u000a\u000aMany years ago before we had supermarkets we were eating a healthier diet, now because of processed foods and the popularity of fast food outlets our diets have changed. A diet of food from an acidic range is causing many health problems now, and cancer is just one of them. For instance, many of our foods are refined, and most of our bread and other baked foods are made from refined white flour.\u000a\u000aSome other examples of acid forming foods are; pasta, cheese, ice cream and butter, jams and jellies, alcohol and soft drinks. All acid forming foods are not necessarily bad; it\u2019s just our diet is out of balance, and if you are dealing with any serious health problem it\u2019s essential to look carefully at what you are eating.\u000a\u000aSome of the alkaline foods are fresh fruit and nearly all freshly grown vegetables. Also consuming, nuts, seeds, grains and legumes are all alkaline foods. It\u2019s important to remember that the changes you make to a more alkaline diet have many health benefits including removing cancer naturally.\u000a\u000aWhile cancer has some other contributing factors, the most important cause is what we eat, because our health is directly related to our dietary choices. Our diet has changed over the last 40 to 70 years, and most of what we eat now is available in supermarkets and supermarkets have an overwhelming influence on what we now buy.\u000a\u000aMuch of what\u2019s available in supermarkets is processed, and because of it, this food is low in nutritional value, and that is without question the reason why there is so much cancer now. It makes a lot of sense if you are dealing with cancer that the first and the most important change you make is with your diet and that you select from a more alkaline range. Also, make sure it\u2019s fresh and if all possible that it is organic.\u000a\u000ahttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2754915/\u000a\u000ahttp://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/why-alkaline-approach-can-successfully-treat-cancer?page=2#_edn6\u000a\u000ahttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19746253

V(Natural News) Despite the mandate voters gave congressional Republicans to repeal and replace Obamacare, some GOP leaders, especially in the Senate, are getting cold feet. As such, they are now playing politics, and frankly, that\u2019s not going to sit well with President Donald J. Trump, who also ran on the \u201crepeal and replace Obamacare\u201d platform.\u000a\u000aIn comments to CNN that were reported by The Hill, Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., used language like \u201crepair\u201d Obamacare, because he and other GOP leaders are more concerned about the optics of repeal than they are about actually doing the right thing for the country.\u000a\u000aAs such, Johnson and others are now making excuses as to why they cannot just repeal the law as they promised.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think more and more people are, as they\u2019re starting to take a look at the daunting task of how do you start repairing the damage of ObamaCare, realizing it\u2019s not particularly easy,\u201d he said, adding that Republicans will now have to work with Democrats to get any repeal done because of the Senate\u2019s 60-vote filibuster threshold.\u000a\u000aIn a word, Johnson is lying. There\u2019s just no diplomatic way of saying this.\u000a\u000aTo prove it, we need to remember how the Democratic majority passed Obamacare in the first place. So let\u2019s review: They did it through the budget reconciliation process. (RELATED: What new threats to your freedoms and liberties are they passing today? Find out at BigGovernment.news)\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s that? As noted by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the process comes from the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, which \u201callows for expedited consideration of certain tax, spending, and debt limit legislation.\u201d\u000a\u000aSince lawmakers never wanted partisan politics to hold up the process of paying the country\u2019s bills, budget measures require only simple majorities in both chambers of Congress to pass; this means that in the Senate, budget reconciliation bills are not subject to the filibuster rule, requiring 60 votes to pass.\u000a\u000aAs the CBPP notes:\u000a\u000aThe Congressional Budget Act permits using reconciliation for legislation that changes spending, revenues, and the federal debt limit. On the spending side, reconciliation can be used to address \u201cmandatory\u201d or entitlement spending \u2014 that is, programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, federal civilian and military retirement, SNAP (formerly known as food stamps), and farm programs \u2014 but not Social Security. Mandatory spending is determined by rules set in ongoing authorizing laws, so changing spending usually requires amending those laws. Reconciliation has not been used to change \u201cdiscretionary\u201d spending, which is spending controlled through the annual appropriations process. [Emphasis added]\u000a\u000aThere\u2019s more. Since midway through the Reagan administration, rules of the Senate have not allowed the inclusion of measures in reconciliation bills that change the level of spending, revenues or the debt limit. This is important to note, because though Obamacare mandated additional spending (primarily in the form of subsidies \u2013 which are provided via Medicaid), the law also included several tax increases to cover the additional costs. So, theoretically then, the law did not change the spending levels or revenues, and never addressed the debt limit.\u000a\u000aSo, for Johnson and others to now claim that the Republican congressional majority can\u2019t fully repeal and replace Obamacare in exactly the same way that Democrats passed it \u2013 by making Obamacare part of the federal budget \u2013 is utter nonsense. Some Senate Republicans, including Johnson, are now claiming that the Senate parliamentarian, a federal bureaucrat whose job it is to know the chamber\u2019s rules, says it would take the 60 votes necessary to overcome the filibuster rule, but as we\u2019ve demonstrated, that\u2019s nothing but political smoke.\u000a\u000aIf the Senate parliamentarian allowed Obamacare to be part of budget reconciliation in order to become reality in the first place, there is no rule the parliamentarian can cite now that would prevent its repeal.\u000a\u000aSo why are Republicans getting cold feet? Simple: The optics of repeal. The establishment media and Democrats are waiting to pounce on them for \u201ctaking away healthcare coverage from poor, suffering Americans,\u201d and the GOP leadership doesn\u2019t want to put itself in that position.

As such, they are now playing politics, and frankly, that&#8217;s not going to sit well with President Donald J. Trump, who also ran on the &#8220;repeal and replace Obamacare&#8221; platform.</p>\u000a<p>In comments to CNN that <a href="http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/315088-gop-senator-lets-work-with-dems-to-fix-obamacare">were reported by The Hill</a>, Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., used language like &#8220;repair&#8221;&#160;Obamacare, because he and other GOP leaders are more concerned about the optics of repeal than they are about actually doing the right thing for the country.</p>\u000a<p>As such, Johnson and others are now making excuses as to why they cannot just repeal the law as they promised.</p>\u000a<p>&#8220;I think more and more people are, as they&#8217;re starting to take a look at the daunting task of how do you start repairing the damage of ObamaCare, realizing it&#8217;s not particularly easy,&#8221; he said, adding that Republicans will now have to work with Democrats to get any repeal done because of the Senate&#8217;s 60-vote filibuster threshold.</p>\u000a<p>In a word, Johnson is lying. There&#8217;s just no diplomatic way of saying this.</p>\u000a<p>To prove it, we need to remember how the Democratic majority passed Obamacare in the first place. So let&#8217;s review: They did it through the budget reconciliation process. (RELATED: What new threats to your freedoms and liberties are they passing today? <a href="http://www.biggovernment.news/">Find out at BigGovernment.news</a>)</p>\u000a<p>What&#8217;s that? As <a href="http://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-budget/introduction-to-budget-reconciliation">noted by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities</a>, the process comes from the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, which &#8220;allows for expedited consideration of certain tax, spending, and debt limit legislation.&#8221;</p>\u000a<p>Since lawmakers never wanted partisan politics to hold up the process of paying the country&#8217;s bills, budget measures require only simple majorities in both chambers of Congress to pass; this means that in the Senate, budget reconciliation bills are not subject to the filibuster rule, requiring 60 votes to pass.</p>\u000a<p>As the CBPP notes:</p>\u000a<p>The Congressional Budget Act permits using reconciliation for legislation that changes spending, revenues, and the federal debt limit. &#160;<strong>On the spending side, reconciliation can be used to address &#8220;mandatory&#8221; or entitlement spending &#8212; that is, programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, federal civilian and military retirement, SNAP (formerly known as food stamps), and farm programs</strong> &#8212; but not Social Security.&#160; Mandatory spending is determined by rules set in ongoing authorizing laws, so changing spending usually requires amending those laws. &#160;Reconciliation has not been used to change &#8220;discretionary&#8221; spending, which is spending controlled through the annual appropriations process. [Emphasis added]</p>\u000a<p>There&#8217;s more. Since midway through the Reagan administration, rules of the Senate have not allowed the inclusion of measures in reconciliation bills that change the level of spending, revenues or the debt limit. This is important to note, because though Obamacare mandated additional spending (primarily in the form of subsidies &#8211; which are provided via Medicaid), the law also included several tax increases to cover the additional costs. So, theoretically then, the law did not change the spending levels or revenues, and never addressed the debt limit.</p>\u000a<p>So, for Johnson and others to now claim that the Republican congressional majority can&#8217;t fully repeal and replace Obamacare in exactly the same way that Democrats passed it &#8211; by making Obamacare part of the federal budget &#8211; is utter nonsense. Some Senate Republicans, including Johnson, are now claiming that the Senate parliamentarian, a federal bureaucrat whose job it is to know the chamber&#8217;s rules, says it would take the 60 votes necessary to overcome the filibuster rule, but as we&#8217;ve demonstrated, that&#8217;s nothing but political smoke.</p>\u000a<p>If the Senate parliamentarian allowed Obamacare to be part of budget reconciliation in order to become reality in the first place, there is no rule the parliamentarian can cite now that would prevent its repeal.</p>\u000a<p>So why are Republicans getting cold feet?

VThe Mail on Sunday can reveal a landmark paper exaggerated global warming\u000a\u000aIt was rushed through and timed to influence the Paris agreement on climate change\u000a\u000aAmerica\u2019s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration broke its own rules\u000a\u000aThe report claimed the pause in global warming never existed, but it was based on misleading, \u2018unverified\u2019 data\u000a\u000a(Article by David Rose from Dailymail.co.uk)\u000a\u000aThe Mail on Sunday today reveals astonishing evidence that the organisation that is the world\u2019s leading source of climate data rushed to publish a landmark paper that exaggerated global warming and was timed to influence the historic Paris Agreement on climate change.\u000a\u000aA high-level whistleblower has told this newspaper that America\u2019s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) breached its own rules on scientific integrity when it published the sensational but flawed report, aimed at making the maximum possible impact on world leaders including Barack Obama and David Cameron at the UN climate conference in Paris in 2015.\u000a\u000aThe report claimed that the \u2018pause\u2019 or \u2018slowdown\u2019 in global warming in the period since 1998 \u2013 revealed by UN scientists in 2013 \u2013 never existed, and that world temperatures had been rising faster than scientists expected. Launched by NOAA with a public relations fanfare, it was splashed across the world\u2019s media, and cited repeatedly by politicians and policy makers.\u000a\u000aBut the whistleblower, Dr John Bates, a top NOAA scientist with an impeccable reputation, has shown The Mail on Sunday irrefutable evidence that the paper was based on misleading, \u2018unverified\u2019 data.\u000a\u000aIt was never subjected to NOAA\u2019s rigorous internal evaluation process \u2013 which Dr Bates devised.\u000a\u000aHis vehement objections to the publication of the faulty data were overridden by his NOAA superiors in what he describes as a \u2018blatant attempt to intensify the impact\u2019 of what became known as the Pausebuster paper.\u000a\u000aHis disclosures are likely to stiffen President Trump\u2019s determination to enact his pledges to reverse his predecessor\u2019s \u2018green\u2019 policies, and to withdraw from the Paris deal \u2013 so triggering an intense political row.\u000a\u000aCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Microsoft CEO Bill Gates, US President Barack Obama, French President Francois Hollande and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the world climate change conference\u000a\u000aThe PM, the Prince and \u2018the pause': David Cameron and Prince Charles attended the historic 2015 Paris climate change conference with 150 world leaders. Cameron committed Britain to an EU-Wide emission cut as a result. And Charles, writing in this paper last month, stated there was no pause in global warming, influenced by the flawed NOAA paper that made this claim\u000a\u000aIn an exclusive interview, Dr Bates accused the lead author of the paper, Thomas Karl, who was until last year director of the NOAA section that produces climate data \u2013 the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) \u2013 of \u2018insisting on decisions and scientific choices that maximised warming and minimised documentation\u2026 in an effor t to discredit the notion of a global warming pause, rushed so that he could time publication to influence national and international deliberations on climate policy\u2019.\u000a\u000aDr Bates was one of two Principal Scientists at NCEI, based in Asheville, North Carolina.\u000a\u000aOfficial delegations from America, Britain and the EU were strongly influenced by the flawed NOAA study as they hammered out the Paris Agreement \u2013 and committed advanced nations to sweeping reductions in their use of fossil fuel and to spending £80 billion every year on new, climate-related aid projects.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe scandal has disturbing echoes of the \u2018Climategate\u2019 affair which broke shortly before the UN climate summit in 2009, when the leak of thousands of emails between climate scientists suggested they had manipulated and hidden data. Some were British experts at the influential Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia.\u000a\u000aNOAA\u2019s 2015 \u2018Pausebuster\u2019 paper was based on two new temperature sets of data \u2013 one containing measurements of temperatures at the planet\u2019s surface on land, the other at the surface of the seas.\u000a\u000aBoth datasets were flawed. This newspaper has learnt that NOAA has now decided that the sea dataset will have to be replaced and substantially revised just 18 months after it was issued, because it used unreliable methods which overstated the speed of warming. The revised data will show both lower temperatures and a slower rate in the recent warming trend.\u000a\u000aThe land temperature dataset used by the study was afflicted by devastating bugs in its software that rendered its findings \u2018unstable\u2019.\u000a\u000aThe paper relied on a preliminary, \u2018alpha\u2019 version of the data which was never approved or verified.\u000a\u000aA final, approved version has still not been issued. None of the data on which the paper was based was properly \u2018archived\u2019 \u2013 a mandatory requirement meant to ensure that raw data and the software used to process it is accessible to other scientists, so they can verify NOAA results.\u000a\u000aDr Bates retired from NOAA at the end of last year after a 40-year career in meteorology and climate science. As recently as 2014, the Obama administration awarded him a special gold medal for his work in setting new, supposedly binding standards \u2018to produce and preserve climate data records\u2019.\u000a\u000aYet when it came to the paper timed to influence the Paris conference, Dr Bates said, these standards were flagrantly ignored.\u000a\u000aThe paper was published in June 2015 by the journal Science. Entitled \u2018Possible artifacts of data biases in the recent global surface warming hiatus\u2019, the document said the widely reported \u2018pause\u2019 or \u2018slowdown\u2019 was a myth.\u000a\u000aLess than two years earlier, a blockbuster report from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which drew on the work of hundreds of scientists around the world, had found \u2018a much smaller increasing trend over the past 15 years 1998-2012 than over the past 30 to 60 years\u2019. Explaining the pause became a key issue for climate science. It was seized on by global warming sceptics, because the level of CO2 in the atmosphere had continued to rise.\u000a\u000aWHY OBAMA\u2019S GREEN GURU WILL MAKE TRUMP SEE RED\u000a\u000aNOAA\u2019s climate boss Thomas Karl, below left, had a hotline to the White House, through his long association with President Obama\u2019s science adviser, John Holdren.\u000a\u000aKarl\u2019s \u2018Pausebuster\u2019 paper was hugely influential in dictating the world agreement in Paris and sweeping US emissions cuts. President Trump, above right, has pledged to scrap both policies \u2013 triggering furious claims by Democrats he is a climate \u2018denier\u2019 and \u2018anti-science\u2019.\u000a\u000aThanks to today\u2019s MoS story, NOAA is set to face an inquiry by the Republican-led House science committee.\u000a\u000aSome scientists argued that the existence of the pause meant the world\u2019s climate is less sensitive to greenhouse gases than previously thought, so that future warming would be slower. One of them, Professor Judith Curry, then head of climate science at the Georgia Institute of Technology, said it suggested that computer models used to project future warming were \u2018running too hot\u2019.\u000a\u000aHowever, the Pausebuster paper said while the rate of global warming from 1950 to 1999 was 0.113C per decade, the rate from 2000 to 2014 was actually higher, at 0.116C per decade. The IPCC\u2019s claim about the pause, it concluded, \u2018was no longer valid\u2019.\u000a\u000aThe impact was huge and lasting. On publication day, the BBC said the pause in global warming was \u2018an illusion caused by inaccurate data\u2019.\u000a\u000aOne American magazine described the paper as a \u2018science bomb\u2019 dropped on sceptics.\u000a\u000aIts impact could be seen in this newspaper last month when, writing to launch his Ladybird book about climate change, Prince Charles stated baldly: \u2018There isn\u2019t a pause\u2026 it is hard to reject the facts on the basis of the evidence.\u2019\u000a\u000aThe sea dataset used by Thomas Karl and his colleagues \u2013 known as Extended Reconstructed Sea Surface Temperatures version 4, or ERSSTv4, tripled the warming trend over the sea during the years 2000 to 2014 from just 0.036C per decade \u2013 as stated in version 3 \u2013 to 0.099C per decade. Individual measurements in some parts of the globe had increased by about 0.1C and this resulted in the dramatic increase of the overall global trend published by the Pausebuster paper. But Dr Bates said this increase in temperatures was achieved by dubious means. Its key error was an upwards \u2018adjustment\u2019 of readings from fixed and floating buoys, which are generally reliable, to bring them into line with readings from a much more doubtful source \u2013 water taken in by ships. This, Dr Bates explained, has long been known to be questionable: ships are themselves sources of heat, readings will vary from ship to ship, and the depth of water intake will vary according to how heavily a ship is laden \u2013 so affecting temperature readings.\u000a\u000aDr Bates said: \u2018They had good data from buoys. And they threw it out and \u201ccorrected\u201d it by using the bad data from ships. You never change good data to agree with bad, but that\u2019s what they did \u2013 so as to make it look as if the sea was warmer.\u2019\u000a\u000aERSSTv4 \u2018adjusted\u2019 buoy readings up by 0.12C. It also ignored data from satellites that measure the temperature of the lower atmosphere, which are also considered reliable. Dr Bates said he gave the paper\u2019s co-authors \u2018a hard time\u2019 about this, \u2018and they never really justified what they were doing.\u2019\u000a\u000aNow, some of those same authors have produced the pending, revised new version of the sea dataset \u2013 ERSSTv5. A draft of a document that explains the methods used to generate version 5, and which has been seen by this newspaper, indicates the new version will reverse the flaws in version 4, changing the buoy adjustments and including some satellite data and measurements from a special high-tech floating buoy network known as Argo. As a result, it is certain to show reductions in both absolute temperatures and recent global warming.\u000a\u000aThe second dataset used by the Pausebuster paper was a new version of NOAA\u2019s land records, known as the Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN), an analysis over time of temperature readings from about 4,000 weather stations spread across the globe.\u000a\u000aThe unstable land readings: Scientists at NOAA used land temperature data from 4,000 weather stations (pictured, one in Montana, USA). But the software used to process the figures was bug-ridden and unstable. NOAA also used \u2018unverified\u2019 data that was not tested or approved. This data as merged with unreliable sea surface temperatures\u000a\u000aThe \u2018adjusted\u2019 sea readings: Average sea surface temperatures are calculated using data from weather buoys (pictured). But NOAA \u2018adjusted\u2019 these figures upwards to fit with data taken from ships \u2013 which is notoriously unreliable. This exaggerated the warming rate, allowing NOAA to claim in the paper dubbed the \u2018Pausebuster\u2019 that there was no \u2018pause\u2019\u000a\u000aThis new version found past temperatures had been cooler than previously thought, and recent ones higher \u2013 so that the warming trend looked steeper. For the period 2000 to 2014, the paper increased the rate of warming on land from 0.15C to 0.164C per decade.\u000a\u000aIn the weeks after the Pausebuster paper was published, Dr Bates conducted a one-man investigation into this. His findings were extraordinary. Not only had Mr Karl and his colleagues failed to follow any of the formal procedures required to approve and archive their data, they had used a \u2018highly experimental early run\u2019 of a programme that tried to combine two previously separate sets of records.\u000a\u000aThis had undergone the critical process known as \u2018pairwise homogeneity adjustment\u2019, a method of spotting \u2018rogue\u2019 readings from individual weather stations by comparing them with others nearby.\u000a\u000aHowever, this process requires extensive, careful checking which was only just beginning, so that the data was not ready for operational use. Now, more than two years after the Pausebuster paper was submitted to Science, the new version of GHCN is still undergoing testing.\u000a\u000aMoreover, the GHCN software was afflicted by serious bugs. They caused it to become so \u2018unstable\u2019 that every time the raw temperature readings were run through the computer, it gave different results. The new, bug-free version of GHCN has still not been approved and issued. It is, Dr Bates said, \u2018significantly different\u2019 from that used by Mr Karl and his co-authors.\u000a\u000aDr Bates revealed that the failure to archive and make available fully documented data not only violated NOAA rules, but also those set down by Science. Before he retired last year, he continued to raise the issue internally. Then came the final bombshell. Dr Bates said: \u2018I learned that the computer used to process the software had suffered a complete failure.\u2019\u000a\u000aThe reason for the failure is unknown, but it means the Pausebuster paper can never be replicated or verified by other scientists.\u000a\u000aThe flawed conclusions of the Pausebuster paper were widely discussed by delegates at the Paris climate change conference. Mr Karl had a longstanding relationship with President Obama\u2019s chief science adviser, John Holdren, giving him a hotline to the White House.\u000a\u000aThe red line shows the current NOAA world temperature graph \u2013 elevated in recent years due to the \u2018adjusted\u2019 sea data. The blue line is the Met Office\u2019s independent HadCRUT4 record. Although they are offset in temperature by 0.12°C due to different analysis techniques, they reveal that NOAA has been adjusted and so shows a steeper recent warming trend.\u000a\u000aThey were forced to correct it: 18 months after the \u2018Pausebuster\u2019 paper was published in time for the 2015 Paris climate change conference, NOAA\u2019s flawed sea temperature dataset is to be replaced. The new version will remedy its failings, and use data from both buoys and satellites (pictured) \u2013 which some say is the best data of all. The new version will show both lower temperatures and a lower warming trend since 2000\u000a\u000aMr Holdren was also a strong advocate of robust measures to curb emissions. Britain\u2019s then Prime Minister David Cameron claimed at the conference that \u201897 per cent of scientists say climate change is urgent and man-made and must be addressed\u2019 and called for \u2018a binding legal mechanism\u2019 to ensure the world got no more than 2C warmer than in pre-industrial times.\u000a\u000aPresident Obama stressed his Clean Power Plan at the conference, which mandates American power stations to make big emissions cuts.\u000a\u000aPresident Trump has since pledged he will scrap it, and to withdraw from the Paris Agreement.\u000a\u000aWhatever takes its place, said Dr Bates, \u2018there needs to be a fundamental change to the way NOAA deals with data so that people can check and validate scientific results. I\u2019m hoping that this will be a wake-up call to the climate science community \u2013 a signal that we have to put in place processes to make sure this kind of crap doesn\u2019t happen again.\u000a\u000a\u2018I want to address the systemic problems. I don\u2019t care whether modifications to the datasets make temperatures go up or down. But I want the observations to speak for themselves, and for that, there needs to be a new emphasis that ethical standards must be maintained.\u2019\u000a\u000aHe said he decided to speak out after seeing reports in papers including the Washington Post and Forbes magazine claiming that scientists feared the Trump administration would fail to maintain and preserve NOAA\u2019s climate records.\u000a\u000aDr Bates said: \u2018How ironic it is that there is now this idea that Trump is going to trash climate data, when key decisions were earlier taken by someone whose responsibility it was to maintain its integrity \u2013 and failed.\u2019\u000a\u000aNOAA not only failed, but it effectively mounted a cover-up when challenged over its data. After the paper was published, the US House of Representatives Science Committee launched an inquiry into its Pausebuster claims. NOAA refused to comply with subpoenas demanding internal emails from the committee chairman, the Texas Republican Lamar Smith, and falsely claimed that no one had raised concerns about the paper internally.\u000a\u000aLast night Mr Smith thanked Dr Bates \u2018for courageously stepping forward to tell the truth about NOAA\u2019s senior officials playing fast and loose with the data in order to meet a politically predetermined conclusion\u2019. He added: \u2018The Karl study used flawed data, was rushed to publication in an effort to support the President\u2019s climate change agenda, and ignored NOAA\u2019s own standards for scientific study.\u2019\u000a\u000aProfessor Curry, now the president of the Climate Forecast Applications Network, said last night: \u2018Large adjustments to the raw data, and substantial changes in successive dataset versions, imply substantial uncertainties.\u2019\u000a\u000aIt was time, she said, that politicians and policymakers took these uncertainties on board.\u000a\u000aLast night Mr Karl admitted the data had not been archived when the paper was published. Asked why he had not waited, he said: \u2018John Bates is talking about a formal process that takes a long time.\u2019 He denied he was rushing to get the paper out in time for Paris, saying: \u2018There was no discussion about Paris.\u2019\u000a\u000aHe also admitted that the final, approved and \u2018operational\u2019 edition of the GHCN land data would be \u2018different\u2019 from that used in the paper\u2019.\u000a\u000aAs for the ERSSTv4 sea dataset, he claimed it was other records \u2013 such as the UK Met Office\u2019s \u2013 which were wrong, because they understated global warming and were \u2018biased too low\u2019. Jeremy Berg, Science\u2019s editor-in-chief, said: \u2018Dr Bates raises some serious concerns. After the results of any appropriate investigations\u2026 we will consider our options.\u2019 He said that \u2018could include retracting that paper\u2019.NOAA declined to comment.\u000a\u000a\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s not the first time we\u2019ve exposed dodgy climate data, which is why we\u2019ve dubbed it: Climate Gate 2\u000a\u000aDr John Bates\u2019s disclosures about the manipulation of data behind the \u2018Pausebuster\u2019 paper is the biggest scientific scandal since \u2018Climategate\u2019 in 2009 when, as this pa per reported, thousands of leaked emails revealed scientists were trying to block access to data, and using a \u2018trick\u2019 to conceal embarrassing flaws in their claims about global warming.\u000a\u000aBoth scandals suggest a lack of transparency and, according to Dr Bates, a failure to observe proper ethical standards.\u000a\u000aBecause of NOAA \u2019s failure to \u2018archive\u2019 data used in the paper, its results can never be verified.\u000a\u000aLike Climategate, this scandal is likely to reverberate around the world, and reignite some of science\u2019s most hotly contested debates.\u000a\u000aLeft, blowing up the graph show is disappears in 1961 artfully hidden behind the other colours.

Some were British experts at the influential Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia.</p>\u000a<p class="mol-para-with-font">NOAA&#8217;s 2015 &#8216;Pausebuster&#8217; paper was based on two new temperature sets of data &#8211; one containing measurements of temperatures at the planet&#8217;s surface on land, the other at the surface of the seas.</p>\u000a<p id="ext-gen130" class="mol-para-with-font">Both datasets were flawed. This newspaper has learnt that NOAA has now decided that the sea dataset will have to be replaced and substantially revised just 18 months after it was issued, because it used unreliable methods which overstated the speed of warming. The revised data will show both lower temperatures and a slower rate in the recent warming trend.</p>\u000a<p class="mol-para-with-font">The land temperature dataset used by the study was afflicted by devastating bugs in its software that rendered its findings &#8216;unstable&#8217;.</p>\u000a<p class="mol-para-with-font">The paper relied on a preliminary, &#8216;alpha&#8217; version of the data which was never approved or verified.</p>\u000a<p id="ext-gen131" class="mol-para-with-font">A final, approved version has still not been issued.

Entitled &#8216;Possible artifacts of data biases in the recent global surface warming hiatus&#8217;, the document said the widely reported &#8216;pause&#8217; or &#8216;slowdown&#8217; was a myth.</p>\u000a<p class="mol-para-with-font">Less than two years earlier, a blockbuster report from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which drew on the work of hundreds of scientists around the world, had found &#8216;a much smaller increasing trend over the past 15 years 1998-2012 than over the past 30 to 60 years&#8217;. Explaining the pause became a key issue for climate science. It was seized on by global warming sceptics, because the level of CO2 in the atmosphere had continued to rise.</p>\u000a\u000a<h1 class="mol-para-with-font">WHY OBAMA&#8217;S GREEN GURU WILL MAKE TRUMP SEE RED</h1>\u000a\u000a<p>NOAA&#8217;s climate boss Thomas Karl, below left, had a hotline to the White House, through his long association with President Obama&#8217;s science adviser, John Holdren.</p>\u000a<p><a href="../wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Karl-Pausebuster.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-88497" src="../wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Karl-Pausebuster-268x300.jpg" alt="Dr.Thomas R.

President Trump, above right, has pledged to scrap both policies &#8211; triggering furious claims by Democrats he is a climate &#8216;denier&#8217; and &#8216;anti-science&#8217;.</p>\u000a<p class="mol-para-with-font">Thanks to today&#8217;s MoS story, NOAA is set to face an inquiry by the Republican-led House science committee.</p>\u000a<p id="ext-gen136" class="mol-para-with-font">Some scientists argued that the existence of the pause meant the world&#8217;s climate is less sensitive to greenhouse gases than previously thought, so that future warming would be slower. One of them, Professor Judith Curry, then head of climate science at the Georgia Institute of Technology, said it suggested that computer models used to project future warming were &#8216;running too hot&#8217;.</p>\u000a<p class="mol-para-with-font">However, the Pausebuster paper said while the rate of global warming from 1950 to 1999 was 0.113C per decade, the rate from 2000 to 2014 was actually higher, at 0.116C per decade. The IPCC&#8217;s claim about the pause, it concluded, &#8216;was no longer valid&#8217;.</p>\u000a<p class="mol-para-with-font">The impact was huge and lasting. On publication day, the BBC said the pause in global warming was &#8216;an illusion caused by inaccurate data&#8217;.</p>\u000a<p class="mol-para-with-font">One American magazine described the paper as a &#8216;science bomb&#8217; dropped on sceptics.</p>\u000a<p class="mol-para-with-font">Its impact could be seen in this newspaper last month when, writing to launch his Ladybird book about climate change, Prince Charles stated baldly: &#8216;There isn&#8217;t a pause&#8230; it is hard to reject the facts on the basis of the evidence.&#8217;</p>\u000a<p class="mol-para-with-font">The sea dataset used by Thomas Karl and his colleagues &#8211; known as Extended Reconstructed Sea Surface Temperatures version 4, or ERSSTv4, tripled the warming trend over the sea during the years 2000 to 2014 from just 0.036C per decade &#8211; as stated in version 3 &#8211; to 0.099C per decade. Individual measurements in some parts of the globe had increased by about 0.1C and this resulted in the dramatic increase of the overall global trend published by the Pausebuster paper. But Dr Bates said this increase in temperatures was achieved by dubious means. Its key error was an upwards &#8216;adjustment&#8217; of readings from fixed and floating buoys, which are generally reliable, to bring them into line with readings from a much more doubtful source &#8211; water taken in by ships. This, Dr Bates explained, has long been known to be questionable: ships are themselves sources of heat, readings will vary from ship to ship, and the depth of water intake will vary according to how heavily a ship is laden &#8211; so affecting temperature readings.</p>\u000a<p class="mol-para-with-font">Dr Bates said: &#8216;They had good data from buoys. And they threw it out and &#8220;corrected&#8221; it by using the bad data from ships. You never change good data to agree with bad, but that&#8217;s what they did &#8211; so as to make it look as if the sea was warmer.&#8217;</p>\u000a<p class="mol-para-with-font">ERSSTv4 &#8216;adjusted&#8217; buoy readings up by 0.12C. It also ignored data from satellites that measure the temperature of the lower atmosphere, which are also considered reliable. Dr Bates said he gave the paper&#8217;s co-authors &#8216;a hard time&#8217; about this, &#8216;and they never really justified what they were doing.&#8217;</p>\u000a<p class="mol-para-with-font">Now, some of those same authors have produced the pending, revised new version of the sea dataset &#8211; ERSSTv5. A draft of a document that explains the methods used to generate version 5, and which has been seen by this newspaper, indicates the new version will reverse the flaws in version 4, changing the buoy adjustments and including some satellite data and measurements from a special high-tech floating buoy network known as Argo. As a result, it is certain to show reductions in both absolute temperatures and recent global warming.</p>\u000a<p class="mol-para-with-font">The second dataset used by the Pausebuster paper was a new version of NOAA&#8217;s land records, known as the Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN), an analysis over time of temperature readings from about 4,000 weather stations spread across the globe.</p>\u000a<p><a href="../wp-content/uploads/2017/02/NOAA.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-88498 aligncenter" src="../wp-content/uploads/2017/02/NOAA-300x295.jpg" alt="An ARL technician checking equipment at the Climate Reference Network Site in Wolf Point, MT.

This exaggerated the warming rate, allowing NOAA to claim in the paper dubbed the &#8216;Pausebuster&#8217; that there was no &#8216;pause&#8217;</strong></p>\u000a<p class="mol-para-with-font">This new version found past temperatures had been cooler than previously thought, and recent ones higher &#8211; so that the warming trend looked steeper. For the period 2000 to 2014, the paper increased the rate of warming on land from 0.15C to 0.164C per decade.</p>\u000a<p id="ext-gen139" class="mol-para-with-font">In the weeks after the Pausebuster paper was published, Dr Bates conducted a one-man investigation into this. His findings were extraordinary. Not only had Mr Karl and his colleagues failed to follow any of the formal procedures required to approve and archive their data, they had used a &#8216;highly experimental early run&#8217; of a programme that tried to combine two previously separate sets of records.</p>\u000a<p class="mol-para-with-font">This had undergone the critical process known as &#8216;pairwise homogeneity adjustment&#8217;, a method of spotting &#8216;rogue&#8217; readings from individual weather stations by comparing them with others nearby.</p>\u000a<p class="mol-para-with-font">However, this process requires extensive, careful checking which was only just beginning, so that the data was not ready for operational use. Now, more than two years after the Pausebuster paper was submitted to Science, the new version of GHCN is still undergoing testing.</p>\u000a<p class="mol-para-with-font">Moreover, the GHCN software was afflicted by serious bugs. They caused it to become so &#8216;unstable&#8217; that every time the raw temperature readings were run through the computer, it gave different results. The new, bug-free version of GHCN has still not been approved and issued. It is, Dr Bates said, &#8216;significantly different&#8217; from that used by Mr Karl and his co-authors.</p>\u000a<p class="mol-para-with-font">Dr Bates revealed that the failure to archive and make available fully documented data not only violated NOAA rules, but also those set down by Science. Before he retired last year, he continued to raise the issue internally. Then came the final bombshell. Dr Bates said: &#8216;I learned that the computer used to process the software had suffered a complete failure.&#8217;</p>\u000a<p class="mol-para-with-font">The reason for the failure is unknown, but it means the Pausebuster paper can never be replicated or verified by other scientists.</p>\u000a<p class="mol-para-with-font">The flawed conclusions of the Pausebuster paper were widely discussed by delegates at the Paris climate change conference.

Britain&#8217;s then Prime Minister David Cameron claimed at the conference that &#8216;97 per cent of scientists say climate change is urgent and man-made and must be addressed&#8217; and called for &#8216;a binding legal mechanism&#8217; to ensure the world got no more than 2C warmer than in pre-industrial times.</p>\u000a<p class="mol-para-with-font">President Obama stressed his Clean Power Plan at the conference, which mandates American power stations to make big emissions cuts.</p>\u000a<p class="mol-para-with-font">President Trump has since pledged he will scrap it, and to withdraw from the Paris Agreement.</p>\u000a<p class="mol-para-with-font">Whatever takes its place, said Dr Bates, &#8216;there needs to be a fundamental change to the way NOAA deals with data so that people can check and validate scientific results. I&#8217;m hoping that this will be a wake-up call to the climate science community &#8211; a signal that we have to put in place processes to make sure this kind of crap doesn&#8217;t happen again.</p>\u000a<p class="mol-para-with-font">&#8216;I want to address the systemic problems. I don&#8217;t care whether modifications to the datasets make temperatures go up or down. But I want the observations to speak for themselves, and for that, there needs to be a new emphasis that ethical standards must be maintained.&#8217;</p>\u000a<p class="mol-para-with-font">He said he decided to speak out after seeing reports in papers including the Washington Post and Forbes magazine claiming that scientists feared the Trump administration would fail to maintain and preserve NOAA&#8217;s climate records.</p>\u000a<p class="mol-para-with-font">Dr Bates said: &#8216;How ironic it is that there is now this idea that Trump is going to trash climate data, when key decisions were earlier taken by someone whose responsibility it was to maintain its integrity &#8211; and failed.&#8217;</p>\u000a<p class="mol-para-with-font">NOAA not only failed, but it effectively mounted a cover-up when challenged over its data. After the paper was published, the US House of Representatives Science Committee launched an inquiry into its Pausebuster claims. NOAA refused to comply with subpoenas demanding internal emails from the committee chairman, the Texas Republican Lamar Smith, and falsely claimed that no one had raised concerns about the paper internally.</p>\u000a<p class="mol-para-with-font">Last night Mr Smith thanked Dr Bates &#8216;for courageously stepping forward to tell the truth about NOAA&#8217;s senior officials playing fast and loose with the data in order to meet a politically predetermined conclusion&#8217;. He added: &#8216;The Karl study used flawed data, was rushed to publication in an effort to support the President&#8217;s climate change agenda, and ignored NOAA&#8217;s own standards for scientific study.&#8217;</p>\u000a<p class="mol-para-with-font">Professor Curry, now the president of the Climate Forecast Applications Network, said last night: &#8216;Large adjustments to the raw data, and substantial changes in successive dataset versions, imply substantial uncertainties.&#8217;</p>\u000a<p class="mol-para-with-font">It was time, she said, that politicians and policymakers took these uncertainties on board.</p>\u000a<p class="mol-para-with-font">Last night Mr Karl admitted the data had not been archived when the paper was published. Asked why he had not waited, he said: &#8216;John Bates is talking about a<img class=" size-medium wp-image-88502 alignright" src="../wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Played-fast-300x73.jpg" alt="Played fast" width="300" height="73"> formal process that takes a long time.&#8217; He denied he was rushing to get the paper out in time for Paris, saying: &#8216;There was no discussion about Paris.&#8217;</p>\u000a<p id="ext-gen143" class="mol-para-with-font">He also admitted that the final, approved and &#8216;operational&#8217; edition of the GHCN land data would be &#8216;different&#8217; from that used in the paper&#8217;.</p>\u000a<p class="mol-para-with-font">As for the ERSSTv4 sea dataset, he claimed it was other records &#8211; such as the UK Met Office&#8217;s &#8211; which were wrong, because they understated global warming and were &#8216;biased too low&#8217;. Jeremy Berg, Science&#8217;s editor-in-chief, said: &#8216;Dr Bates raises some serious concerns. After the results of any appropriate investigations&#8230; we will consider our options.&#8217; He said that &#8216;could include retracting that paper&#8217;.NOAA declined to comment.</p>\u000a<p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;</strong></p>\u000a<h2 class="mol-para-with-font">It&#8217;s not the first time we&#8217;ve exposed dodgy climate data, which is why we&#8217;ve dubbed it: Climate Gate 2</h2>\u000a<p id="ext-gen146" class="mol-para-with-font">Dr John Bates&#8217;s disclosures about the manipulation of data behind the &#8216;Pausebuster&#8217; paper is the biggest scientific scandal since &#8216;Climategate&#8217; in 2009 when, as this pa<img class="  wp-image-88503 alignright" src="../wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Helena-220x300.jpg" alt="Helena" width="191" height="260">per reported, thousands of leaked emails revealed scientists were trying to block access to data, and using a &#8216;trick&#8217; to conceal embarrassing flaws in their claims about global warming.</p>\u000a<p class="mol-para-with-font">Both scandals suggest a lack of transparency and, according to Dr Bates, a failure to observe proper ethical standards.</p>\u000a<p class="mol-para-with-font">Because of NOAA &#8217;s failure to &#8216;archive&#8217; data used in the paper, its results can never be verified.</p>\u000a<p class="mol-para-with-font">Like Climategate, this scandal is likely to reverberate around the world, and reignite some of science&#8217;s most hotly contested debates.</p>\u000a<p><a href="../wp-content/uploads/2017/02/3CD7C58C00000578-4192182-image-m-95_1486249428566.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-88504 alignleft" src="../wp-content/uploads/2017/02/3CD7C58C00000578-4192182-image-m-95_1486249428566-284x300.jpg" alt="Page:13; Day:13; Split:None" width="284" height="300"></a></p>\u000a<p><a href="../wp-content/uploads/2017/02/3CD7C72500000578-4192182-image-m-97_1486249524213.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-88505" src="../wp-content/uploads/2017/02/3CD7C72500000578-4192182-image-m-97_1486249524213-284x300.jpg" alt="Page:13; Day:13; Split:None" width="284" height="300"></a></p>\u000a<p>&#160;</p>\u000a<p><strong>Left, blowing up the graph show is disappears in 1961 artfully hidden behind the other </strong>colours<strong>.

VOriginal article and analysis by Dave Hodges of The Commonsense Show.\u000a\u000aPresident Trump may have escaped the clutches of Hillary Clinton. But can he escape the danger posed by the Democratic/Communist Party who are agents of the globalists and whose main goal is the destruction of the United States?\u000a\u000aThe following comprise the \u201chit team\u201d who want to take him out and subjugate the American people.\u000a\u000aEnemies Within\u000a\u000aPresident Trump faces an unthinkable challenge. He is not only faced with dealing with over 80 Congressmen who are members of front organizations for the Communist party and the Muslim Brotherhood, he has many of these philosophical traitors to the Republic serving in senior and mid-level management in the various agencies of the Federal government. In other words, the President is surrounded by traitors who are dedicated to the destruction of the United States. Their traitors are your enemy whether you realize it or not!\u000a\u000aPlease allow me to superficially review how extensive the treason to the Republic is. This will be followed up by a stunning revelation as the end of the article.\u000a\u000aTreason In Our Midst\u000a\u000aWas anyone else bothered by the fact the large body count of Democratic Congressmen who did not attend the Inauguration. These unpatriotic Congressmen were led by the very radicalized John Lewis. Lewis belongs to the Progressive Caucus which a clear front organization for the Communist Party as are the other disloyal Congressmen.\u000a\u000aAt minimum, I am concerned because these Congressmen demonstrated that they will not work with this President. This is troublesome because the Congress and the President must work together for the good of the country.\u000a\u000aAt maximum, I am concerned about this development because questions about these Congressmen are being asked by my audience with regard to their real motivation. Many of my readers and viewers are questioning if these Congressmen want to simply be \u201cout of the blast zone\u201d for what is coming. In other words they are positioning themselves to survive the coup that is coming.\u000a\u000aNew Zealand Journalist, Trevor Loudon, documents, through his new documentary entitled The Enemies Within) how the Communist Party of the USA itself has adopted a stealth plan to achieve revolutionary goals by decisions made in the 1970s to infiltrate and manipulate the Democratic Party. Loudon\u2019s newest work documents how Lewis is a member of several front organizations with strong ties to the Community Party.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe Communist and Muslim Brotherhood infiltration plan is to form alliances with the radical elements in organized labor in conjunction with radicals in the African-American community and the feminist movement to establish a progressive coalition on the left that could dominate the national political agenda for decades to come.\u201d John Lewis is a member of the Progressive Caucus which is a front group for the Communist Party. Lewis is not alone, but his actions and allegiances speak to his lack of commitment to the Republic and most importantly, the Constitution of The United States.\u000a\u000aWith these associations and his continual efforts in dividing the country, this Congressman should resign. Our country has reached its saturation point with treason from its public officials. Lewis has lost all credibility. Fromer Congressman, Alan West, has identified 80 of these Congressman as belonging to front groups for either the Communist party or the Muslim Brotherhood, or both.\u000a\u000aThe Muslim Brotherhood Invasion of DHS and the White House\u000a\u000aThe Deputy Chief of Staff to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Huma Abedin\u000a\u000aThis section is not about Muslims serving in the White House. America has no problem with this so long as they uphold their oath to protect and defend the Constitution. This section is also not about The embarrassed and disgraced wife of deposed Congressman, Anthony Weiner, Huma Abedin, has undeniable family ties to the Muslim Brotherhood. In an interview with FrontPageMag, anti-Islamist activist and author Walid Shoebat explained that Huma\u2019s mother, Saleha Abedin, is and was deeply involved with the Muslim Brotherhood and that Huma\u2019s brother, Hassan, is on the board of the Oxford Centre For Islamic Studies (OCIS) where he is a fellow and partners with other board members including \u201cAl-Qaeda associate, Omar Naseef and the notorious Muslim Brotherhood leader Sheikh Youssef Qaradawi; both have been listed as OCIS Trustees.\u201d Has the FBI stopped vetting Federal governmental employees in highly sensitive positions?\u000a\u000aDepartment of Homeland Security Deputy Mayor, Arif Alikhan In the publication, Discover the Networks, the editors discuss the background as it relates to highly sensitive federal agency employment (e.g. DHS) and the Muslim terrorist affiliations of Arif Alikhan. Alikhan\u2019s resume is very impressive. \u201cFormer deputy mayor of Homeland Security and Public Safety for the City of Los Angeles\u000a\u000aWas responsible for derailing the LAPD\u2019s plan to monitor activities within the Los Angeles Muslim community\u000a\u000aWas appointed as assistant secretary for the Office of Policy Development in Barack Obama\u2019s Department of Homeland Security in 2009\u000a\u000aBecame a Professor of Homeland Security and Counterterrorism in 2010.\u201d\u000a\u000aNow serving as a distinguished, visiting professor at the National Defense University. Alikhan was responsible for derailing the LAPD\u2018s efforts to monitor radical and potentially terrorist activities within the city\u2019s Muslim community, where numerous radical mosques were known to have provided aid and comfort to the 9/11 hijackers. Alikhan, an openly devout Sunni Muslim, has openly participated in a Muslim Public Affairs Council fundraiser titled \u201cBe the Change,\u201d in order to support that organization\u2019s leadership-development programs which openly advocates for the Sharia Law takeover of the United States. The open support for this Sharia Law intention to overthrow the U.S. government, on the part of an American citizen, is illegal. When such an advocate is a Federal employee in a sensitive position this person should disqualify one from holding sensitive positions within the government.\u000a\u000aObama Administration Advisory Council on Faith-Based Neighborhood Partnerships, Eboo Patel\u000a\u000aIf you were on the FBI team vetting Presidential appointees, would you grant your seal of approval to the grandson of the Muslim Brotherhood\u2019s founder, Siraj Wahhaj, who was named as a co-conspirator in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and who has defended the convicted WTC bombers. Well, somebody thought Eboo Patel, the man in question would make a splendid member of Obama\u2019s Advisory Council on Faith-Based Neighborhood Partnerships.\u000a\u000aAdditionally, Patel, himself, spoke at a Muslim Students Association and ISNA Convention, while appearing on a panel, and also being partnered with Tariq Ramadan.\u000a\u000aRamadan is the grandson of Siraj Wahhaj, who was named as a possible co-conspirator in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and has defended the convicted WTC bombers. Wahhaj advocates for the Islamic takeover of America under the banner of Sharia Law.\u000a\u000aAll of these people combined, plus GEORGE SOROS, are poised to overthrow this government and the intention, to do so, extends deep into every agency. Obama had 8 years to plant subversive time bombs.\u000a\u000aState Department Employee, Monika Wesolowski\u000a\u000aFor the past 72 hours, I have covered the case of State Department employee, Monika Wesolowski. Through and off-handed, unintentional comment, Monika revealed that State Department brochures obfuscate the presence of child-sex trafficking inside the territorial boundaries of the United States.\u000a\u000aSince I published the two part story about Monika, I have heard from several Federal employees who verify the aforementioned concern and further, they make claims that parts of our Federal government are actually involved in facilitating child-sex trafficking and the people\u2019s resources are involved.

V(Natural News) America\u2019s student loan crisis has grown far worse than anyone has been willing to admit \u2013 at least until now.\u000a\u000aOn January 13, the U.S. Department of Education released a memo stating that the agency\u2019s previously published statistics regarding student loans were inaccurate and that repayment rates had been exaggerated for 99.8 percent of the colleges and trade schools listed.\u000a\u000aThe most recent calculations reveal that more than 50 percent of loan recipients from 1,000 different lending institutions have either defaulted or not made any of their payments over the last seven years. (RELATED: Read Collapse.news for coverage of the coming economic collapse.)\u000a\u000aMore than 44 million Americans have student loan debt and the total in outstanding loans has now reached $1.3 trillion.\u000a\u000aThe new figures completely contradict those provided only recently by the Department of Education, proving that the government cannot be trusted to tell the truth regarding the extent of the student loan fiasco \u2013 a crisis that places a serious burden on a large segment of the U.S. economy.\u000a\u000aFrom CBN News:\u000a\u000a\u201cLarge-scale non-payment of student loans has broader economic implications. Defaults can have long-lasting ramifications, as student loan debt generally cannot be discharged through bankruptcy. Without massive forgiveness programs or some other means of useful debt relief, a significant segment of an entire generation may be pushed to the economic sidelines \u2014 unable to afford a home and provide a market for starter homes, unwilling to start families under such an economic burden, and incapable of saving enough for their retirement.\u201d\u000a\u000aSome experts are comparing the potential economic effects of the student loan crisis to those of the foreclosure crisis of 2008 and 2009. During that period, roughly one in ten homeowners were 90 days delinquent on their mortgage payments. Today, the overall delinquency rate for student loans is more than 11 percent and has been that way for more than four years.\u000a\u000aFrom ValueWalk:\u000a\u000a\u201cImagine if we were told that, year after year, more than one in ten homeowners simply weren\u2019t making payments in the midst of an economic expansion. It would be deemed an unsustainable disaster. And yet, that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing with student loans right now.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhat many people do not recognize is the fact that student loans are a major contributing factor to spiraling tuition costs. Over the past two decades, the average cost for four years tuition at a public college jumped more than 200 percent. Colleges are able to continue hiking tuition costs because they know the government will continue to make loans easily available. (RELATED: Find more news about the rigged system at RIGGED.news.)\u000a\u000aUnder Donald Trump, no one is expecting sweeping changes to the system, but he has promised an end to the \u201cstudent loans scam\u201d that he blames squarely on the federal government. His stance on student loan payments and forgiveness programs seems to be more liberal than many of his Republican colleagues, but his specific plans for dealing with the issue are not yet clear.\u000a\u000aMany observers, including President Trump himself, believe that the most effective solution is the creation of more U.S. jobs, as there is certainly no easy, quick-fix for the crisis as it stands.\u000a\u000aAs long as a college education costs more than what a student can pay for working a part-time job \u2013 something that was once possible until \u201chuge sums of money were handed out to anyone with a pulse\u201d (as Shaun Bradley of Anti-Media put it), subsequently driving up the price of tuition \u2013 there will continue to be an issue with student loan debt in America.\u000a\u000aPerhaps the concept of a taxpayer-funded free college education isn\u2019t such a bad idea after all, compared to what we have now.

VOver twenty years ago, Pat Palmer, in her own words, \u201cstumbled upon a $400 overcharge in a bill my father received for a routine medical procedure.\u201d That might have become the costliest \u201covercharge\u201d the gouging, overbilling health care industry ever inflicted on itself. Because it led Ms. Palmer, whom Steve Brill (author of the Time Magazine cover story, \u201cWhy Medical Bills are Killing Us,\u201d April 4, 2013) called \u201cone of my earliest tutors as I tried to figure out the dysfunctional world of medical economics and billing,\u201d to start a business investigating the overbilling of patients.\u000a\u000aLocated in Roanoke, Virginia, Medical Billing Advocates of America (MBAA) (billadvocates.com) makes money by saving patients money. No savings, no charge. In twenty years, she has collected a multitude of cases of doctors, hospitals and insurance companies overcharging. This evidence reflects routine, everyday overbilling in the many billions of dollars a year.\u000a\u000aHow extensive is this commercial crime wave? The nation\u2019s expert on computerized billing fraud, Malcolm Sparrow, who is an applied mathematician at Harvard, estimates medical billing fraud adds up to a minimum sum of $270 billion a year or at least ten percent of all health care expenses. His classic book, License to Steal, showed that these ripoffs are not just clerical errors or computer malfunctions. The systemic fraud goes far beyond the organized criminal syndicates defrauding Medicare that the FBI raids once in a while. The frauds are designed with corporate interests in mind to filch your wallet directly or under the nose of unobservant insurers, from the very design of billing statements to the manipulation of codes.\u000a\u000aPat Palmer is out with a paperback titled Surviving Your Medical Bills, which is self-published by her firm, MBAA. Ms. Palmer explained she almost gave up on \u201call the rules and regulations that no one is enforcing.\u201d It\u2019s a good thing she didn\u2019t. Instead, Ms. Palmer decided to rile up the patients and their families directly with her book by describing how outrageously brazen billing practices are (not just an aberration) and showing how people can become common-sense investigators if they receive these shocking bills.\u000a\u000aStart with the fact that about eighty percent of all medical bills contain errors, with the average error being $1,300. Most of these overbillings favor, unsurprisingly, the sellers (euphemistically called \u201cthe providers\u201d). Ms. Palmer says the situation has been getting worse. With the number of diagnostic codes growing from 17,000 to about 60,000 under Obamacare, to supposedly improve efficiency, the system has become even more complicated, with hospitals and few others knowing how to game or beat the system.\u000a\u000aShe lists many of the ways that medical bills are hugely inflated, using the technique known as unbundling, when tests and procedures are broken down into their individual components, which allows for double or triple billing. Some hospitals also, by their own admission, incorporate their overhead in the itemized pricing of even simple items like $20 aspirins or $15 disposable razors.\u000a\u000aAn example of double-billing technique is when a patient is charged thousands of dollars a day for being in an intensive care unit (ICU) and then also charged for the ventilator which is already factored into the cost of the ICU. Hospitals charge for their mistakes as in the radiology department. Another example is when they charge, say $12, for each time a nurse brings you an aspirin, even though you\u2019re paying for these hospital services in your room rate. Transporting that aspirin is called an \u201coral administration fee.\u201d Gobbleygook names are omnipresent in these bills.\u000a\u000aYou can get these itemizations by refusing to accept a \u201csummary bill,\u201d and ask, as is your right under state law, to receive an itemized bill which sometimes will extend to pages of computer printout in inscrutable code that you can then demand an explanation in ordinary English.\u000a\u000aHospital billings for similar services or items vary wildly and arbitrarily. Ms. Palmer found a hospital charging $444.78 for a 10-milligram vial of the neuromuscular blocking drug Norcuron. She then found another hospital \u201ccharging $17.90 for the very same 10-milligram vial.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn her book, she often refers to documented examples of massive overbilling on major surgeries, major medical equipment and lesser items. People have been charged for phantom procedures, nominal physician visits, for hospital employees transporting specimens down a few floors to the labs. Patients, are charged for omnibus services and products, then charged again and again for the pieces.\u000a\u000aNow obviously there are variations as well in levels of honesty and fraud between institutions and practices. But overall, what Palmer and Sparrow are writing about is, arguably, our country\u2019s biggest commercial crime wave.\u000a\u000aHowever, strangely, prosecutors reserve their few grand jury indictments largely for the criminal underworld stealing from Medicare or other insurers. For the corporate establishment, there are always the easy ways out such as confessing error, but not intent, when caught or arguing reasonable industry practices. They quickly correct the specific bill of its offending bloat and satisfy the complaining patient, but nothing changes overall.\u000a\u000aClearly the current criminal laws do not adequately prevent such computerized theft and need to be amended to account for this fraud. Furthermore, if our nation followed the example of other countries and transitioned to a universal full Medicare for-all-system, this would end fee for service and the Pat Palmers would be out of business (see singlepayeraction.org for more information).\u000a\u000aThe main point of this book is that if enough outraged or concerned patients can follow Pat Palmer\u2019s clear roadmap and challenge the bilkers, maybe the law enforcers will get the message and maybe the lawmakers will give these law enforcers the budgets to stop these widespread corporate crimes.\u000a\u000aShare and Enjoy

VElder Care, the Herb Kratom Can Help Geriatric Patients Become More Lucid and Active

VElder care presents so many problems for the children who, in their prime working years, must arrange some way to care for their aging parents.

They had initially wanted to remove her whole digestive system, but she refused, thankfully. She lived ten years after the discovery of her cancer\u2026 Don\u2019t think she would have had that long were she to listen to them\u2026 Chemo always put her in bed, progressively worse\u2026\u201d\u000a\u000aNancy: \u201cI wish I had a video of my 84 yr old Mom trying to toss and wash!! I ended up making her some tea ( which I should have done in the first place). But she so rarely takes a pain medication, that it\u2019s just easier for her.\u201d\u000a\u000aJames: \u201cI had an older lady, she is 89 years old now, that came in for massage every other week. She had been living with scoliosis for her entire life. Her back looked like one of those \u201ccurves ahead\u201d signs on roads, almost a perfect \u201cS\u201d.\u000a\u000aI offered her Kratom about 3 years ago. Massage was helping with her pain, but not stopping it completely. I wanted her to feel no pain.\u000a\u000aShe still takes her kratom. I send it to her every month (she is on social security, so she can\u2019t afford to buy it). She takes 14 ounces every month, and says her pain is gone on most days.\u000a\u000aShe was only taking pain medication (lortab) when she started coming to me for Massage. She is off of those now.\u000a\u000aFor her age, and her back being totally screwed up, she is in surprisingly good health. She says that she has more energy now, and even started a new rose garden last year.\u000a\u000aI honestly believe this lady (Miss Mary) will outlive me.\u201d\u000a\u000aWendi: \u201cMy 83 year old father in law LOVES Premium Bali kratom for All his aches and pains- and he has shared it with many of his friends in that age group!\u201d\u000a\u000aAng: \u201cWe just started my half-sister\u2019s mother and her husband on kratom and what a life changer it has been for them. They are in their eighties.\u000a\u000aShe suffers from Addison\u2019s Disease and they both were just having lack of energy and were just going downhill really, really fast just from old age, but Wow what a difference kratom made!\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s getting them out and getting them active again when they were both home and bedridden, pretty much.\u000a\u000aI just couldn\u2019t believe the difference in my sister\u2019s mother and her husband after the first 2 weeks \u2014 it was like night and day! I\u2019m going to guarantee that it will probably prolong their life because they\u2019re not dormant and stationary. Now they actually can get up and around the house and go on errands with my sisters whenever they have to go to the store for him and stuff.\u201d\u000a\u000aKay: My elderly neighbor, that I was taking kratom to, was eventually taken to the hospital because of some swelling in his arm. When he came back home on other meds along with OxyContins, he started going down from there. It was awful to watch my friend slowly \u201cgo away\u201d. I went over one morning and saw that he had had a stroke, so he went back in the hospital and died. I know I can\u2019t blame one thing, but he was doing good with the kratom and that was a big dose of \u201cOxies\u201d for such a tiny frail man. Because of the Oxys, all he did was sleep and he could barely walk. I miss my buddy!\u201d\u000a\u000aAuthor\u2019s Comment: It\u2019s just my layman\u2019s opinion, having read these accounts of happier outcomes in elder care with kratom \u2014 and my own experience of seeing my mother\u2019s decline, due to a broken hip, a hospital stay, and the \u201cbest\u201d nursing home care \u2014 kratom would have been a far better option if it had been available then for her elder care, compared to the mind-robbing medications and Electro-Convulsive Therapy they treated her with (the latter without my prior knowledge or permission, as her legal guardian).

V(Natural News) According to a blockbuster new analysis from the Center for Immigration Studies, a total of 72 individuals who came from President Trump\u2019s seven named terror-linked countries have been convicted in terrorism-related cases since 9/11.\u000a\u000aThis finding demolishes the absurd, fact-less assertion of the Ninth Circuit judges who claimed there is \u201cno evidence\u201d of terrorism from those seven nations.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe Center has extracted information on 72 individuals named in the Senate report whose country of origin is one of the seven terror-associated countries included in the vetting executive order: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen,\u201d reports CIS, which also states:\u000a\u000aThe United States has admitted terrorists from all of the seven dangerous countries:\u000a\u000aSomalia: 20\u000a\u000aYemen: 19\u000a\u000aIraq: 19\u000a\u000aSyria: 7\u000a\u000aIran: 4\u000a\u000aLibya: 2\u000a\u000aSudan: 1\u000a\u000aTotal: 72\u000a\u000aAccording to the report, at least 17 individuals entered as refugees from these terror-prone countries.

V(Natural News) Former President Barak Obama knew that Donald Trump wanted to stop funding the United Nations Green Climate Fund (GCF), so right before Obama left office, he sent them $500 million of taxpayer money. The US state department stood up for Obama\u2019s illegal move by falsely claiming that the Green Climate Fund isn\u2019t an international organization, therefore making sending funds to the GCF doesn\u2019t violate federal law. Obama also previously gave the GCF a $500 million installment from seized funds which were designated by Congress for Zika research.\u000a\u000aObama knowingly violated the law because his administration had received letters from nearly half of the US Senate in April, letting them know it\u2019s unlawful to send money to the UN fund. (RELATED: Find more Obama news at Obama.fetch.news)\u000a\u000aRepublicans were outraged when Obama gave away the first installment of $500 million because they saw it as an illegal waste of taxpayer money. The Obama administration went around Congress in a move nobody supported to funnel this money to the UN. Donald Trump\u2019s administration can block future payments to the fund, but some believe that would cause an uneasy situation with the other countries who have contributed to the GCF.\u000a\u000aMany scientists and experts believe the GCF is a corrupt entity with no means to promote economic or political stability. The GCF is said to have been designed as a large slush fund for Third World governments and dictators who participate in the UN\u2019s Green Climate Fund. Almost half of the countries involved threatened to walk away back in 2015 unless western governments forked over $100 billion from their taxpayers annually.\u000a\u000aCritics were happy to chime in on how stupid the GCF is. \u201cThis is a direct subsidy to, frankly, to kleptocracies,\u201d said notable physicist Dr. Fred Singer. \u201cWe know what happens to that money. It goes into the pockets or bank accounts of the people who run these countries \u2014 it\u2019s been happening all the time, and I think it will continue to happen. So, as someone put it, it\u2019s a matter of the poor in the rich countries supporting the rich in the poor countries,\u201d said the University of Virginia environmental sciences professor.\u000a\u000aBarack Obama essentially stabbed America in the back on his way out of the oval office. The checks he cut the UN\u2019s Green Climate Fund were unlawful insults to the US, and perfect for his radical globalist agenda. It remains to be seen whether the money can be recovered by the Trump administration, and if they will pursue any criminal charges against Obama and members of his administration for the blatant violations.

VAside from the perfect sweet and sour combination that it can give our taste buds, blueberries are also known to be antioxidants which are helpful against inflammation. Flavonoids and anthocyanins are two antioxidants that are acquired from consuming blueberries and they play a major role in high of activity contribute antioxidative in a person\u2019r body as they help precent systolic and diastolic blood pressure. In fact, it has been rumored that these antioxidants can do it better than pharmaceutical products out there.\u000a\u000aThe compound mainly responsible for releifing the blood pressure and is common to flavonoids and anthocyanins is pterostilbene. The compound is usually found in fruits under the berry family but the quantity is just more from blueberries. It can be compared to reservatrol which is present in the skin of the fruit except that pterostilbene has greater capabilities and is useful against cancer and diabetes.\u000a\u000aThere are also studies and research done by experts trying to discover more health benefits out of blueberries aside from its capability to control blood pressure, fight cancer cells and diabetes. Some of the research being done is to identify whether blueberries can protect against Alzheimer\u2019s disease and other heart diseases. No wonder why a lot of people love blueberries these days.\u000a\u000aThe Power of Blueberries on Blood Pressure\u000a\u000aIn a recent study done by researchers at the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, it was concluded that by taking at least 20 grams of blueberry powder for 2 months straight resulted to reductions blood pressure bpth diastolic and systolic at 5.2% and 6.4% respectively. This only goes to show that blueberry has great potential. Dr. A. Archambeault of ACD even commented that several patients that were on antihypertensives saw a decrease of less than five percent in their blood pressure so it is a natural product that can may eventuallt prove to be better than other known drugs. With more research being done surrounding blueberries then it would be possible to create a very powerful medication in the future out of blueberry powder combined with additional antioxidants.\u000a\u000aThe positive effects of blueberry consumption can also be attributed to the increased level of nitric oxide in the specimen\u2019s body from 9 micromoles up to 15 micromoles after 2 months. It is a known vasodilator that can help relax arteries and veins and stabilize blood pressure. Although there is no direct link if blueberries also contain a lot of nitric oxide, this angle should be developed soon.\u000a\u000aThe maximum potential of blueberries is yet to be determined but it has already been proven that it has positive effects on the function of arteries and that it can prevent the possibility of worst-case hypertension. Since the case of hypertension in America alone is very prevalent then advanced research that can help develop strategies and dietary modification that can help improve hypertension along with the complications associated with it should be warranted.\u000a\u000aGrowing Public Interest\u000a\u000aWeeks ago, the Journal of Clinical Nutrition America published on their website that flavonoids from blueberries can indeed increase the endothelial functions and improve heart condition without having any solid evidence to back up their statements. Given that the organization is well trusted by Americans then it was automatic for the public to believe such statement even though it can still be considered as compelling. Endothelial function is a big factor towards blood pressure specifically after the menopausal stage. Dysfunction in this area can cause stiffness in arteries which can develop into other serious problems such as hypertension and cardiovascular issues.\u000a\u000aIn a separate study conducted by ACS\u2019 Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, they found out that there are hundreds of blueberry species in the areas of South and Central America. Some of these species contain more significant antioxidants compared to the regular blueberries that are being sold in the supermarkets. If these so-called super fruits are the ones that are going to be tested for the research that were mentioned above instead of regular blueberries then the results can be more promising given that more flavonoids and anthocyanins can be acquired from these fruits.\u000a\u000aNew Study Launched\u000a\u000aA group of Florida researchers recruited 50 women for their 8-week experiment involving blueberries. Half of the participants had just a cup blueberries which were fresh included in their diet while the others stuck with their regular diet without any intake of blueberries. The results clearly showed a significant decrease in blood pressure of the people who had a blueberry diet while the others were able to maintain or worse suffered from high blood pressure during the 8 weeks.\u000a\u000aThis study only cemented that blueberries alone has a significant impact towards blood pressure if used as a added dietary component. Pharmaceutical companies should now be open to using blueberry powder as the main ingredient to create medication or supplements that can help maintain healthy blood pressure and as well as boost cardiovascular health. The fruit has already been proven after multiple studies and a little more push will further cement it as the ultimate remedy for blood pressure issues.\u000a\u000aReference:\u000a\u000aRead more about blood pressure and steps to control it.\u000a\u000ahttp://www.medicaldaily.com/blueberries-may-help-control-blood-pressure-321276\u000a\u000ahttps://healthimpactnews.com/2015/blueberries-outperforming-pharmaceuticals-in-reducing-blood-pressure/

If these so-called super fruits are the ones that are going to be tested for the research that were mentioned above instead of regular blueberries then the results can be more promising given that more flavonoids and anthocyanins can be acquired from these fruits.</p>\u000a<p><strong>New Study Launched</strong></p>\u000a<p>A group of Florida researchers recruited 50 women for their 8-week experiment involving blueberries. Half of the participants had just a cup blueberries which were fresh included in their diet while the others stuck with their regular diet without any intake of blueberries. The results clearly showed a significant decrease in blood pressure of the people who had a blueberry diet while the others were able to maintain or worse suffered from high blood pressure during the 8 weeks.</p>\u000a<p>&#160;</p>\u000a<p>This study only cemented that blueberries alone has a significant impact towards blood pressure if used as a added dietary component. Pharmaceutical companies should now be open to using blueberry powder as the main ingredient to create medication or supplements that can help maintain healthy blood pressure and as well as boost cardiovascular health. The fruit has already been proven after multiple studies and a little more push will further cement it as the ultimate remedy for blood pressure issues.</p>\u000a<p>&#160;</p>\u000a<p>Reference:</p>\u000a<p><a href="http://www.thrombocyte.com/blood-pressure-chart-numbers/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Read more about blood pressure and&#160;steps to control it</a>.</p>\u000a<p><a href="http://www.medicaldaily.com/blueberries-may-help-control-blood-pressure-321276" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.medicaldaily.com/blueberries-may-help-control-blood-pressure-321276</a></p>\u000a<p><a href="https://healthimpactnews.com/2015/blueberries-outperforming-pharmaceuticals-in-reducing-blood-pressure/" rel="nofollow">https://healthimpactnews.com/2015/blueberries-outperforming-pharmaceuticals-in-reducing-blood-pressure/</a></p>\u000a<p>&#160;</p>\u000a                </div>

V(Natural News) Monsanto public relations are fighting an uphill battle as they try to convince the world that their genetically modified crops are beneficial and necessary. More than ever before, informed people are skeptical of the so-called safety of GMOs and agrochemicals. When the International Agency for Research on Cancer declared that glyphosate was a probable human carcinogen, public opinion on GMO safety quickly shifted.\u000a\u000aNow Monsanto must employ a new strategy to promote GMOs, one that paints dissenters as \u201cideologically driven\u201d and \u201canti-science.\u201d In the United Kingdom, Monsanto headquarters appointed former World Bank communications strategists Vance Crowe to head up a new position called \u201cDirector of Millennial Engagement.\u201d This position was created to convince skeptical young adults that their anti-GMO views are fueled by emotion, not logic. Crowe is scheduled to tour the UK in 2017 and convince millennials that the benefits of GMOs trump the fear surrounding public opinion.\u000a\u000aThe communication expert will engage in public forums and try to relate to millennials\u2019 mistrust of GMOs. His public relation tour is meant to appeal to skeptics in the most persuasive way, disregarding the evidence on GMO health issues by first painting skepticism as fact-less. One of the speaking engagements will be at Glasgow Skeptics, which is an organization that promotes \u201cscience and critical thinking.\u201d The event\u2019s organizer, Brian Eggo, is already on record classifying GMOs skeptics as the kind of people who are guided by ideology and fueled by the public\u2019s unsubstantiated fears of GM technology. In trying to win over skeptics, Brian Eggo said that Glasgow isn\u2019t pro-GM, but will present the scientific facts in a neutral setting. The Monsanto sympathizer says that the discussion on GMO\u2019s should involve \u201cputting aside personal biases, ideologies and preconceived ideas in order to examine what is true.\u201d\u000a\u000aFor those who can see through this PR stunt, it\u2019s obvious that Brian Eggo and Monsanto\u2019s Vance Crowe are making a play on words to paint GMO dissenters as lunatics who don\u2019t follow facts or science. Eggo\u2019s assertion that GM promoters base their views on science is a dead giveaway that Monsanto is just trying to frame the debate so that people will believe in their \u201cscience.\u201d When these communication experts declare up front that those who oppose GMOs are driven by ideology and emotion, they are being intentionally manipulative and using their own science as a device.\u000a\u000aIndustry studies alone do not give a clear picture of the damage that persistent chemicals and continual consumption of GMOs do to humans and the environment. It is the hope of Monsanto and biotech industry that they can convince people to believe in their studies as if it is settled, religious teachings. In this way, they can control the official story on GMOs.\u000a\u000aThere is no scientific consensus on the safety of GM technology. Where one industry-backed study touts its safety, there is another showing the tumors that are the result of GM-rich diets. The real long-term safety tests are continually being carried out on the population. The lasting effect on the environment is also a grave concern.\u000a\u000aThe most common genetically modified crops are engineered to withstand weed killer chemicals such as glyphosate. Since glyphosate is a registered antibiotic, its presence on crops and in food causes microbe depletion (in the soil and in the human gut). This may change how the nutrition of food is assimilated in the human body. (RELATED: For more information on GM technology, visit GMO.news)\u000a\u000aWhen Sri Lanka\u2019s President Mahinda Rajapaksa ordered an immediate ban on glyphosate in 2014, he did so because scientists recognized that glyphosate acts as a vector for heavy metals to flood the kidneys of agricultural workers. This deadly uptake of heavy metals to the kidneys happens because glyphosate depletes the commensal microbes in the gut that protect the gut wall and the blood from heavy metals and other toxins.\u000a\u000aPeople have every reason to emotionally and ideologically detest anything that Monsanto comes up with. Monsanto has a long, sordid history of mass producing chemicals that cause human suffering. Look no further than DDT, agent orange, PCBs, dioxin, saccharin, bovine growth hormone, aspartame, polystyrene, and yes today\u2019s wonderful weedkiller \u2013 glyphosate. Just like we once got serious about banning Monsanto\u2019s DDT, agent orange, PCBs and dioxin, it\u2019s now time to get serious about the damning facts on glyphosate toxicity.\u000a\u000aIf communication experts are being called upon to silence dissent and sway public opinion on the benefits of toxic chemicals and genetic experiments, then it\u2019s time to wake up and start talking about the data and the evidence!\u000a\u000aSources:\u000a\u000aGlobalResearch.ca\u000a\u000aFoodandWaterWatch.org\u000a\u000aEWG.org\u000a\u000aIARC.fr\u000a\u000aCollective-Evolution.com

VEarlier this summer a mom in Cincinnati made an astonishing discovery. Her son accidentally left his Walmart\u2019s Great Value Ice Cream Sandwich outside while playing in 80° F (about 27°C).\u000a\u000aAfter more than 12 hours she found the ice cream her son had left untouched and it wasn\u2019t melted. The woman couldn\u2019t believe what she was seeing and repeated the experiment. And to her astonishment the other ice cream didn\u2019t melt either.\u000a\u000aA video of the everlasting, unmeltable ice cream went viral on internet (click here to see the video). An embarrassed Walmart spokesman came up with the theory that the ice cream sandwich didn\u2019t melt due to its high cream content. But is a high cream content the real ingredient that makes this ice cream unmeltable?\u000a\u000aThe answer is NO, according to a professor Sean O\u2019Keefe. It is actually the other way around. More cream or fat makes ice cream melt faster! Non-fat or non-cream ice cream takes longer to melt due to its higher water content.\u000a\u000aWhat Makes It Unmeltable?\u000a\u000aWalmart\u2019s great value ice cream sandwich contains corn syrup, guar gum, carob bean gum, cellulose gum, carrageenan, artificial flavors, MSG, and much more additives and preservatives that aren\u2019t even considered food. The high amounts of all sorts of gums in this type of ice cream is probably the reason why it doesn\u2019t melt.\u000a\u000aGums are complex carbs that were originally derived from plants to be used as thickeners or gel-forming agents. These days however most gums are synthetically made in the lab.\u000a\u000aGums and other chemically altered substance are not found in high quality or homemade ice creams, but this one bursts with it. Real ice cream, or the one you make at home, actually contains very few ingredients. Milk, cream, sugar, vanilla, chocolate or fresh fruits are basically it.\u000a\u000aArtificial food ingredients have been linked to a wide range of health issues, including cancer, Alzheimer\u2019s, allergies, and cardiovascular issues.\u000a\u000aAnd did you know that to be called an ice cream, the product must only contain 10% milk and the rest can be anything else. So as always make sure to read your labels, avoid processed food and try and make your own and safe ice creams at home so that you absolutely know what\u2019s in them.\u000a\u000aThis Walmart ice cream issue is actually not the only story out there. Have you ever seen the picture passing by from the eternal Mc Donald hamburger that lasts forever without getting moldy (it is spoilage free since 1996)? They found that the meat patty is loaded with salt (sodium) which is a preservative and the hamburger bun doesn\u2019t even come close to real, natural bread.\u000a\u000aSo I can\u2019t stress enough how important it is to read food labels and opt for whole, fresh, organic foods as much as possible.\u000a\u000aAlso read:\u000a\u000a10 Easy Ways To Eat Organic Food Without Breaking The Bank\u000a\u000aClean Eating 101: Simple Rules To Live A Healthy And Clean Lifestyle\u000a\u000a10 Easy Ways To Alkalize Your Body And Improve Overall Health\u000a\u000aDon\u2019t forget to download my FREE green smoothie eBook to sneak more fresh, whole foods into your diet or connect with me on Facebook or Google+ for more healthy tips, tricks, and recipes.

VIn America, almost one in three adults are living with high blood pressure, that\u2019s why the topic of dietary recommendations for high blood pressure is becoming more and more popular these days. What causes high blood pressure? Normally not consuming enough vegetables and fruits can result in a high sodium intake and low potassium intake, which can contribute to developing high blood pressure. So with high blood pressure, you are recommended to have a diet low in sodium and fat, avoid these foods:\u000a\u000aPickles\u000a\u000aPickles are super low in calories and fat, and are also high in vitamin K, which helps your blood clot after the injury, that\u2019s great. But they are loaded with sodium, one medium pickle provides more than 570mg of sodium, that\u2019s more than 1/3 of the daily recommended needs. So if you\u2019re with high blood pressure, limit your pickle intake.\u000a\u000aSauerkraut\u000a\u000aSauerkraut is with several health benefits, including providing vitamin C and K, iron and a good amount of fiber, and it also boosts your immune system, but you should limit the amount you eat, or choose low-sodium brands, as a half cup of it has more than 460 mg of sodium, 19% of your recommended daily intake.\u000a\u000aBacon\u000a\u000aBacon is not only delicious, it\u2019s also like other pork products, contains B-vitamins (vitamin B1, B2, B3, B6, B12), vitamin D as well as the minerals zinc, iron and magnesium, which are all essential for a positive health body. But why most people feel afraid to eat it? As it\u2019s super high in sodium, three slices contain around 270 mg of sodium and 4.5 grams of fat, so it\u2019s wise to try turkey bacon for lower sodium intake instead of the salty&fatty pork bacon.\u000a\u000aWhole Milk\u000a\u000aWhen you\u2019re trying to build muscle, whole milk is your best choice, it provides more fat than you need, a one cup serving of whole milk contains 8 grams of fat. While if you are living with high blood pressure, try using 2% milk, or even better-skim milk, as the saturated fats whole milk contains are bad for you and may lead to heart disease.\u000a\u000aDonuts\u000a\u000aPeople like donuts, for its sweet taste, but they are not good for your health. A single donut can provide more than 300 calories and 12 grams of fat, as they\u2019re fried, means you\u2019re getting lots of saturated and trans fat, which can increase your risk of heart disease.\u000a\u000aRamen Noodles\u000a\u000aRamen noodles are popular among college students all over the world, as they\u2019re inexpensive and so convenient. However, it\u2019s not a healthy choice as they\u2019re lack of nutrients and with lots of unhealthy components. One package of ramen provides 14 grams of fat, including 6 grams of saturated fat, and 1731 grams of sodium, more than 70% of the recommended daily needs! In fact, the flavor packet contains most of the sodium, so to reduce sodium intake, it\u2019s better to not add the flavor packet.\u000a\u000aAlcohol\u000a\u000aDrinking too much alcohol may raise your blood pressure to unhealthy levels, and alcohol can damage the walls of blood vessels. For people with high blood pressure, avoid alcohol totally or drink in moderation. Moderate drinking is generally considered to be:\u000a\u000aOne drink for men age more than 65 per day\u000a\u000aTwo drinks for men younger than age 65 per day\u000a\u000aOne drink for women of any age per day\u000a\u000aA drink is 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine or 1.5 ounces of 80-proof distilled spirits.\u000a\u000aIf you have high blood pressure, limit eating these above foods and focusing on low-sodium foods can help. Some good choices are: potassium-rich bananas, salt-free seasonings, potassium-packed white potatoes, fresh fish, nutrient-packed lima beans, iron-rich spinach, omega-3 fatty acids-rich flaxseed.\u000a\u000aMore from Alex Jordon:\u000a\u000a4 Proven Herbs for Reducing Cholesterol Naturally\u000a\u000aThree Guidelines for Managing Diabetes\u000a\u000aHow To Balance Your Sodium Intake\u000a\u000a4 key and natural ways to maintain your blood pressure

VProposed Presidential Order\u000a\u000aThe Constitution guarantees that all children have a right to go to school, regardless of medical history or vaccination status. In order to protect the right to go to school, a California mom, Sharon Brown, has proposed a presidential order that will establish the fundamental privacy of children\u2019s medical records, which in turn, will end segregation by schools that discriminate against children \u2013 based only on the child\u2019s medical history or vaccination status.\u000a\u000aRegardless of whether you love or hate him, when Donald Trump signs this proposed executive order, it will essentially halt mandatory vaccination in American schools \u2013 because schools won\u2019t be allowed to ask about the child\u2019s medical history or vaccination status \u2013 because under our proposed order \u2013 the child\u2019s medical history and vaccination status will be deemed \u201cprivate.\u201d\u000a\u000aOrigins\u000a\u000aI was recently contacted by a registered nurse who wanted to see Trump issue a presidential order guaranteeing the parents\u2019 right to opt-out of school vaccine programs. \u201cGreat idea!\u201d thought I! I then contacted Sharon Brown, who said, \u201cGreat idea, but\u2026\u201d So now, instead of a presidential order that merely guarantees the right to opt-out of vaccination programs, we decided to propose a broader order \u2013 to prohibit schools from even asking about the children\u2019s medical history in the first place!\u000a\u000aAs Sharon Brown explains: \u201cThe schools have no right to ask about a child\u2019s medical history because it\u2019s none of their business\u2014it\u2019s private! Just like in the workplace\u2014the worker\u2019s medical history is nobody\u2019s business\u2014it\u2019s private!\u201d\u000a\u000aHalting Medical Tyranny\u000a\u000aSharon Brown knows about fighting medical tyranny \u2013 my office represents her and seven other brave parents who are now suing the State of California to halt mandatory vaccination of schoolchildren.

Our goal is clear \u2013 medical records must be regarded as private! So, whether you\u2019re conservative or liberal, please defend the right to privacy!

V(Natural News) Another community \u201cactivist\u201d is in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons. Micah Rhodes, co-leader of Portland Resistance, a group dedicated to fighting Donald Trump and white nationalism, has been arrested.\u000a\u000aThe 23-year-old activist, who is currently on parole for Sex Abuse I and Sodomy I, is now facing four new charges of second-degree sexual assault of a teenage boy and girl, one of whom he met on the gay dating app Tinder.\u000a\u000aAccording to Oregon state records, Rhodes is a registered sex offender, but his name doesn\u2019t appear on the state-run website because he isn\u2019t considered \u2018predatory\u2019 under the liberal interpretation of the law.\u000a\u000aAside from the sex abuse charges, Rhodes, who is heavily involved in Portland\u2019s anti-Trump protests, has also been arrested numerous times over the last few months for disorderly conduct and blocking traffic during Portland\u2019s anti-police protest. [RELATED: See more hidden news at Censored.news]\u000a\u000aAccording to Portland Resistance, the \u201cmovement is not an Anti-Trump movement. It is a movement of love. We have realized that due to Donald Trump\u2019s hateful rhetoric and dangerous policies that we need to organize in our city right now to make sure that we are a beacon of light in a dark time.\u201d\u000a\u000aThey also go on to state, \u201cIn order to survive a Trump Presidency, the rise of white nationalism, and widening income inequality, there needs to be a strong resistance.\u201d\u000a\u000aPortland Resistance is no different than most leftists, anti-capitalist movements; it receives support from George Soros via his front group Moveon.org, which is heavily involved in creating almost all of the color revolutions across the United States.\u000a\u000aIn a recent tweet, Portland Resistance founder Gregory McKelvey was asked \u201cDoes George Soros contact you directly or does he send one of his people?\u201d The resistance leader responded, \u201che just sends checks.\u201d McKelvey seems to enjoy throwing his Soros connection around on Twitter making snarky remarks such as \u201cI got bused in directly from the George Soros mansion! Fun ride.\u201d In another cynical tweet, he replies \u201cmost my comrades just spend their money taking people\u2019s guns away and forcing them to gay marry.\u201d\u000a\u000aMcKelvey can sarcastically scoff at the Soros connects all he wants, but one thing we can prove is Soros has financed most of the violent anti-Trump protests across America via his Open Society Foundation.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s going to be a long eight years for the left if Donald Trump gets re-elected. If perverts, suspected murderers, and Sharia Law sympathizers continue to be the best that the left has to offer, they are in much bigger trouble than anyone thought.\u000a\u000aSources:\u000a\u000aDailyCaller.com\u000a\u000aGofundme.com\u000a\u000aPdxresistance.org

Micah Rhodes, co-leader of Portland Resistance, a group dedicated to fighting Donald Trump and white nationalism, has been arrested.</p>\u000a<p>The 23-year-old activist, who is currently on parole for Sex Abuse I and Sodomy I, is now facing four new charges of second-degree<a href="http://koin.com/2017/01/30/portlands-resistance-co-leader-charged-with-sexual-abuse/"> sexual assault of a teenage boy and girl</a>, one of whom he met on the gay dating app Tinder.</p>\u000a<p>According to Oregon state records, Rhodes is a registered sex offender, but his name doesn&#8217;t appear on the state-run website because he isn&#8217;t considered &#8216;predatory&#8217; under the liberal interpretation of the law.</p>\u000a<p>Aside from the sex abuse charges, Rhodes, who is heavily involved in Portland&#8217;s anti-Trump protests, has also been arrested numerous times over the last few months for disorderly conduct and blocking traffic during Portland&#8217;s anti-police protest.&#160;[RELATED: See more hidden news at <a href="http://censored.news/" target="_blank">Censored.news</a>]&#160;</p>\u000a<p>According to Portland Resistance, the &#8220;movement is not an Anti-Trump movement. It is a movement of love. We have realized that due to Donald Trump&#8217;s hateful rhetoric and dangerous policies that we need to organize in our city right now to make sure that we are a beacon of light in a dark time.&#8221;</p>\u000a<p>They also go on to state, &#8220;In order to survive a Trump Presidency, the rise of white nationalism, and widening income inequality, there needs to be a strong resistance.&#8221;</p>\u000a<p><a href="http://21stcenturywire.com/2016/11/11/color-revolution-george-soros-moveon-agitators-march-on-america-as-billionaire-instigator-sued/">Portland Resistance is no different than most leftists, anti-capitalist movements</a>; it receives support from George Soros via his front group Moveon.org, which is heavily involved in creating almost all of the color revolutions across the United States.</p>\u000a<p><a href="https://twitter.com/GregoryMcKelvey/" target="_blank">In a recent tweet</a>, Portland Resistance founder Gregory McKelvey was asked &#8220;Does George Soros contact you directly or does he send one of his people?&#8221; The resistance leader responded, &#8220;he just sends checks.&#8221; McKelvey seems to enjoy throwing his Soros connection around on Twitter making snarky remarks such as &#8220;I got bused in directly from the George Soros mansion! Fun ride.&#8221; In another cynical&#160;tweet, he replies &#8220;most my comrades just spend their money taking people&#8217;s guns away and forcing them to gay marry.&#8221;</p>\u000a<p>McKelvey can sarcastically scoff at the Soros connects all he wants, but one thing we can prove is Soros has financed most of the<a href="http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/01/23/george-soros-tied-activists-behind-campaign-impeach-trump/" target="_blank"> violent anti-Trump protests</a> across America via his Open Society Foundation.</p>\u000a<p>It&#8217;s going to be a long eight years for the left if Donald Trump gets re-elected. &#160;If perverts, <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2017/01/07/radical-queer-activist-arrested-in-murder-of-woman-at-uc-berkeley/" target="_blank">suspected murderers</a>, and <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2017/01/21/womens-march-organizer-recently-met-ex-hamas-operative-has-family-ties-to-terror-group/" target="_blank">Sharia Law</a>&#160;sympathizers continue to be the best that the left has to offer, they are in much bigger trouble than anyone thought.</p>\u000a<p><strong>Sources:</strong></p>\u000a<p class="font_8"><a href="http://dailycaller.com/2017/01/31/leader-of-portland-anti-trump-protests-charged-with-sexually-abusing-minor/" target="_blank">DailyCaller.com</a></p>\u000a<p class="font_8"><a href="https://www.gofundme.com/portlands-resistance-rebuild-fund" target="_blank">Gofundme.com</a></p>\u000a<p class="font_8"><a href="http://www.pdxresistance.org/" target="_blank">Pdxresistance.org</a></p>\u000a \u000a</div>

VIf you are looking for an easy trick to improve your life and overall health, than look no further. Drinking lemon water first thing in the morning is a pretty simple routine to get into and will have tremendous effects on your overall health.\u000a\u000aSince I started this simple and surprisingly healthy habit a few years ago, I definitely noticed the difference. Not only does the refreshing taste wake me up in the morning, it helps to kick start digestion and finalizes my body\u2019s natural detoxification processes\u2026 And lemons are packed with vitamin C, B, calcium, iron, magnesium, potassium, enzymes, antioxidants, and fibers.\u000a\u000aAccording to the Ayurvedic philosophy, choices you make regarding your daily routine either build up resistance to diseases or tear it down.\u000a\u000aSo what are you waiting for to jump start your day with this incredible easy morning routine. Its benefits are endless and I listed the 15 most important ones for you in this article.\u000a\u000a1. Improves Digestion\u000a\u000aLemon juice has a similar structure to your stomach\u2019s juices and helps to loosen and flush out toxins from the digestive tract. Lemon juice can help ease indigestion, heartburn, and bloating. It also helps to move your bowels in the morning, hydrates your colon, stimulate bile production, and infuses water in your stool.\u000a\u000a2. Boost Immune System.\u000a\u000aLemon juice is rich in vitamin C, which helps strengthen the immunes system and fights cold and flu. But not only vitamin C is important for a good working immune system, iron is another important nutrient, and lemons improve the ability to absorb more iron from the food you eat.\u000a\u000a3. Hydrates Your Body\u000a\u000aIt is important to stay hydrated. Especially during the summer months. Plain water is best, but many people find this boring and are not drinking enough of it. That\u2019s where lemon comes into play to make things more interesting. So feel free to not only start your day with lemon water, but drink as many glasses as you wish during the day to stay hydrated.\u000a\u000a4. Boost Energy\u000a\u000aLemon water gives you an instant boost of energy and improves your mood right at the start of your day.\u000a\u000a5. Promote Healthy And Rejuvenated Skin\u000a\u000aLemons are a rich sources of antioxidants that prevent free radical damage. These free radicals are responsible for pre-mature aging of your skin. Vitamin C helps to maintain your skin\u2019s elasticity to prevent the formation of wrinkles and decrease blemishes.\u000a\u000a6. Reduce Inflammation\u000a\u000aLemons have the ability to remove uric acid from your joints. Uric acid built-ups are one of the major causes of inflammation.\u000a\u000a7. Weight Loss Aid\u000a\u000aAlthough lemon water on its own is no weight loss miracle, it can definitely help you to achieve faster and long term results. Lemons assist in fighting hunger cravings, boost metabolism, and give you a stuffed feeling, making it less likely to snack in between meals.\u000a\u000a8. Alkalize Your Body\u000a\u000aAlthough lemons have a sour taste, they are one of the most alkalizing food sources on Earth. Too much acids can cause inflammation, obesity, and major diseases like cancer, diabetes and Alzheimer\u2019s. Click here to learn more about the importance of alkalizing your body.\u000a\u000a9. Cleansing Properties\u000a\u000aLemons help your entire body to flush out more toxins to prevent built-ups and damage to your cells, tissues, and organs. It stimulates your liver to produce more enzymes and work more efficiently. Lemon juice works as a diuretic to keep your urinary tract toxin-free and can also change the pH levels which discourage bacterial growth. This is very helpful for people who often suffer from UTI (urinary tract infection). And like mentioned before, lemons loosen and flush out waste from your digestive tract and cleanse your colon.\u000a\u000a10.Antibacterial and Antiviral Properties\u000a\u000aLemons have antibacterial and antiviral properties. They help fight the flu, cold, and soothe a sore throat. Although people who drink their daily lemon water every day are less likely to get these in the first place.\u000a\u000a11.Reduce Mucus And Phlegm\u000a\u000aLemon water helps to reduce mucus and phlegm formation. People who drink cow\u2019s milk are often more sensitive for mucus production. So starting your day with lemon water can definitely help to lessen mucus if you\u2019re not ready to go dairy-free.\u000a\u000a12.Freshen Breath\u000a\u000aLemons freshen your breath and fight mouth bacteria. Although lemons are great for your overall oral health, avoid drinking or using it undiluted. The citric acid can erode tooth enamel, so don\u2019t brush your teeth with it, but have a glass of lemon water instead.\u000a\u000a13.Boost Brain Power\u000a\u000aThe high levels of potassium and magnesium show beneficial effects on our brain and nerve health. Lemon water can give you the boost you need to fight depression and stress. It creates mental clarity and more focus, making it a great drink for students or people with busy and stressful jobs.\u000a\u000a14.Anti-cancer\u000a\u000aLemon\u2019s antioxidants not only protect your skin from ageing, but also reduce the risk of several types of cancer. They are great in neutralizing acids as well. Cancer loves to grow in an acidic environment. Alkalizing your body may stop cancer cells to grow and may reduce the risk of getting cancer in the first place.\u000a\u000a15.Get Of Caffeine\u000a\u000aMany people are able to get off caffeine by replacing their morning coffee by lukewarm lemon water. It gives a similar energy boost to wake your body and boost energy as one cup of coffee would.\u000a\u000aHow To Make Lemon Water\u000a\u000aMaking lemon water is super simple. It takes less than 5 minutes of your precious morning time. Just squeeze half a lemon in lukewarm water. If you weigh more than 150 pounds, use a whole lemon.\u000a\u000aWhy use lukewarm (or room temperature) instead of cold or hot water to make this healing morning drink? Well, hot or cold water takes more energy to process, so your first glass in the morning should be lukewarm or at room temperature to slowly wake your body and kick start digestion.\u000a\u000aIf you love the taste feel free to add more lemon water to your diet during the rest of the day, cold or hot. It adds up to your daily water need, is less boring than plain water, and adds tons of benefits for body and mind.\u000a\u000aDon\u2019t forget to download my FREE green smoothie eBook or connect with me on Facebook or Google+ for more healthy tips, tricks, and recipes.

VHalloween is on the horizon and the world just continues to get scarier and scarier \u2014 but not for the fun and enjoyable reasons that the holiday is known for. No, things are getting scary for all the wrong reasons. Between the likelihood of a Hillary Clinton presidency, the creepy clowns trying to lure people into the woods all across the southeast and the increasing amounts of radical Islamic terrorism all over the world, the planet has become a scary place. Now health concerns are making it even scarier.\u000a\u000aA hospital emergency room in Oregon has been quarantined after a mysterious disease caused five people to hallucinate \u2014 and like something out of a horror movie, it spread through physical touch. It all began after a 54-year-old caregiver was admitted to the hospital after claiming to have symptoms associated with hallucinations. Shortly thereafter, four people who had been in physical contact with the caregiver began experiencing the same symptoms.\u000a\u000aFiona MacDonald of Science Alert reports, \u201cA HazMat team was deployed to both the hospital and the caregiver\u2019s residence, while the emergency room was emptied and quarantined to check for the source of the unidentified illness. Experts have so far been unable to locate a common source of contamination. Blood tests of the affected patients also haven\u2019t turned up anything unusual.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe case has baffled the medical professionals that have analyzed it. They are claiming that they see nothing out of the ordinary aside from the obvious hallucinations. That is definitely the scariest part of all of this, because now you have to wonder if this is all a setup. Very rarely do new diseases just pop up without warning. What isn\u2019t so rare is global crises, which seem to happen every other week in this day and age. From the increasing worldwide terrorism to the general evilness of the world today, there is no denying that people out there want to cause us all despair.\u000a\u000aIt is truly horrific that these types of events are still occurring, but thanks to the corruption of Big Pharma, it\u2019s often difficult to tell if health problems are a result of the medications many people take in order to stay healthy. It\u2019s a sad and frightening irony that never seems to improve because the corporations control the media outlets that should be exposing these truths.\u000a\u000aWelcome to 2016 America, where you can randomly start hallucinating and medical \u201cprofessionals\u201d have no answers for you.\u000a\u000aSources:\u000a\u000aScienceAlert.com\u000a\u000aFoxNews.com\u000a\u000aBeckerHospitalReview.com

It&#8217;s a sad and frightening irony that never seems to improve because the corporations control the media outlets that should be exposing these truths.</p>\u000a<p>Welcome to 2016 America, where you can randomly start hallucinating and medical &#8220;professionals&#8221; have no answers for you.</p>\u000a<p>&#160;</p>\u000a<p><strong>Sources:</strong></p>\u000a<p><a href="http://www.sciencealert.com/a-hospital-ward-has-been-quarantined-after-5-people-fall-ill-with-mysterious-hallucinations">ScienceAlert.com</a></p>\u000a<p><a href="http://www.foxnews.com/health/2016/10/13/hospital-lifts-er-quarantine-after-5-develop-hallucinations.html">FoxNews.com</a></p>\u000a<p><a href="http://www.beckershospitalreview.com/quality/hazmat-team-dispatches-to-oregon-hospital-after-mysterious-illness-spreads.html">BeckerHospitalReview.com</a></p>\u000a\u000a \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a<p id="mc_embed_signup">\u000a \u000a</p>\u000a<p></p>\u000a<p></p>\u000a<p></p>\u000a</div>

VProfits, Frauds And Insurance Premiums\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIn the West, there is a widespread consensus that costs of living and social status always mirror one another. The more one can afford the wealthier one is. If this adage is no longer true, maybe was it never true at all. Many among the middle class, who still can purchase some form of healthcare insurance, have realized that their security hangs by a thread. Each year health insurance premiums are set to further skyrocket. The average employee receiving benefits through an employer doesn\u2019t feel safer either as the out of pocket (before the insurance kicks in) ever increases. The out of pocket for a minimum coverage varying between 5,000 dollars and 2,500 respectively.\u000a\u000aIf getting health insurance through the employer is a big plus, a 2,500 dollar expense for family of four still represents financial stress. In 2013, a CNN analysis estimated that 76% of Americans were living from pay check to pay check. Considering that the average household has a mere thousand dollars in savings and credit cards close to being maxed out, financial flexibility has become elusive.\u000a\u000aOverbilling Is Only A Fraud Among \u2018Many\u2019 Others\u000a\u000aAlthough many have access to programs such as medicare, the latter are such in deep red ink. Medicare liabilities amount to $30 trillion. Obamacare did more harm than good. Though realistically speaking, the Trump administration won\u2019t be able to fix anything. Such programs have been the main drive behind healthcare costs and insurance premium increase for many decades. They have fueled the dynamics of demand and supply and reversing the trends is practically impossible. Any new policy attempting to lower the costs in favor of the patients will send the healthcare industry into a tailspin.\u000a\u000aMany hospitals and medical professionals have overbilled insurances for quite some time now. The whole industry is inflationary. So on one end, we find that bad health is often linked to bad eating habits, a stained food chain and various chemical invasions; and on the other end, we have a sector profiting from sickness as if there were no tomorrows. One doesn\u2019t need to be a PhD \u2013 nor a prophet \u2013 to predict how this will end.\u000a\u000aThere have many articles lauding the efficiency and affordability of the Swiss healthcare system. Though even Switzerland has a massive pension fund headache to resolve within 4 years from now. The country could just go under if nothing is done, contended a Financial Times article in 2010. Aging population is a dire problem because the birth rate in the West went drastically down compared to 70 years ago. Financial projections were based on 3 or 4 kids per household. Today the birth rate is about 1.2 or three times less. It is not just Switzerland but the entire West that should be extremely concerned.\u000a\u000aMajor Economies As Health Hazards.\u000a\u000aAmerica and Europe being major economies, money printing to delay the day of reckoning remains a solution. The Federal Reserve has already done that several times since the 2008 crisis. Unfortunately, the price tag has still yet to come. Switzerland and ECB will also have to resort to the printing press. However, we can always cynically speculate on a war causing mass casualties to fix this mathematical equation. While this really sounds like an absolute worse case scenario, world tensions are rising. Something is definitely brewing.\u000a\u000aThe majority assumes that assessing the quality of healthcare systems is a tricky business. That all methods and prognostics have their own flaws. Well, if one is going to monetize the \u2018gift of life\u2018, there are more incentives to profit from diseases to start with. On the other side of the Atlantic, the U.K seems to have the worst healthcare system by far. The latter could collapse at any moment as over 3 million people are on the NHS waiting list. According to the telegraph.uk, hundreds unnecessarily died between 2006 and 2009 waiting to see a doctor! But here comes another aberration. Instead of improving services at home, the U.K is currently projecting to support \u2018care in the community for elderly\u2019 people in China stipulates the Telegraph.uk again. In Canada the state of affair isn\u2019t better at all and care rationing begins to look much like that in the UK.\u000a\u000aCapitalism and Socialism Banding Together\u000a\u000aBy now the trend should rather be obvious: socialized healthcare wouldn\u2019t go anywhere without capitalism and otherwise. Both are putting the Gift Of Life on life support. It all becomes crystal clear when probing the overbilling disaster. Capitalism is antagonistic to efficient treatments. And socialism seeks to further regulate, all of which gives the industry and big-pharma alike more power. According to Malcolm Sparrowd, a mathematician at Harvard, the overbilling fraud estimate adds up to a minimum sum of $270 billion a year or at least ten percent of all health care expenses. Regulations never work because there\u2019re drafted by the one-sided profits hunters themselves and a bunch of aggressive lobbyists buying politics. Any genuine action to fix the mess will destroy healthcare as we know it.

VThings are not looking good for once iconic retailer Sears, who has announced they will be closing hundreds of stores, laying off thousands of employees and selling off millions in assets to stay afloat.\u000a\u000aSince 1925 Sears was at the forefront of brick and mortar. Many remember them for their archetypal \u2018Wish Book\u2019 or their mostly-American-made Craftsman tool brand that carried a lifetime warranty. Their stores were anchors for virtually every American shopping mall. These game changers earned them recognition for being innovators, but the days of being at the forefront of the market are long gone, as the company heads closer to falling off an economic cliff that even Donald Trump can\u2019t stop.\u000a\u000aYou can blame Amazon or the age of the internet, but over the years Sears has lost its competitive edge. Many mistakes have been made but one of the most detrimental was allowing competitors like Home Depot, Lowe\u2019s, and Best Buy to invade their monopoly in the home appliances category. Sears was once the dominant force for families who were looking for high quality refrigerators, washers, and dryers at an affordable price. Sears also trained their employees to be experts on the products in their field, and customers walked away feeling like they were truly taken care of. It was like a family. Today however, Sears is just an afterthought, and because Sears and most retailers did away with thoroughly training associates, customers now choose to go online to compare product and competitor options. This is further proven by the number of storefronts that have shut their doors over the years. (RELATED: Learn more suppressed economic news at Censored.news)\u000a\u000aAnother costly misstep came in 2005 when Kmart and Sears merged to create the third biggest retailer in the United States. The merger left a footprint of almost 3,500 retail stores, 1,100 specialty stores, and $55 billion in annual revenue. Most retail experts were left scratching their heads when the two companies combined, as Kmart had been in serious decline for the last decade and Sears was beginning to follow in Kmart\u2019s footsteps. Today Kmart is practically dead and continues to close hundreds of stores across the United States, all the while Sears continues to burn cash just to stay afloat.\u000a\u000aThe final nail in the coffin for Sears was the choice not to reinvest millions of dollars into its aging stores which desperately needed a \u201cfacelift\u201d and a new assortment of products for the changing market. Instead, Sears CEO Edward S. Lampert spent billions of dollars on \u2018share buy backs,\u2019 a strategy used to give investors the appearance of improved earnings. What more would you expect from a CEO who got his start at money laundering firm Goldman Sachs.\u000a\u000aIn a recent move of desperation, Sears decided to sell its most recognizable brand, Craftsman, to Stanley Black and Decker for $900 million. Sears originally purchased the brand for $500 back in 1927. This is just the beginning of the sell off, as Sears will eventually be forced to dump household name Kenmore appliances to finance its crushing debt.\u000a\u000aSears continues to be a hollow shell of its former self. What was once an imprint of almost 3500 stores has now shrunk to 1,500, leaving hundreds of thousands without work and having a disastrous impact on working class Americans, communities, and the environment. The end of an era is near. (Find out more about the coming collapse.)\u000a\u000aWe can\u2019t fault Sears CEO Edward Lampert for everything; he did get one thing right in his tenure at Sears. In 2010 Lampert bragged that Sears would be \u2018unrecognizable\u2019 in 30 years, however I don\u2019t think this is what he had in mind.\u000a\u000aSources\u000a\u000aRetaildive.com\u000a\u000aSearsholdings.com\u000a\u000aBusinessInsider.com\u000a\u000aNewYorkTimes.com

V(Natural News) \u201cWhen did the future switch from being a promise to being a threat?\u201d \u2015 Chuck Palahniuk, Invisible Monsters\u000a\u000a(Article by John W. Whitehead, republished by rutherford.org)\u000a\u000aDespite our best efforts, we in the American police state seem to be stuck on repeat, reliving the same set of circumstances over and over and over again: egregious surveillance, strip searches, police shootings of unarmed citizens, government spying, censorship, retaliatory arrests, the criminalization of lawful activities, warmongering, indefinite detentions, SWAT team raids, asset forfeiture, etc.\u000a\u000aUnfortunately, as a nation we\u2019ve become so desensitized to the government\u2019s acts of violence, so accustomed to reports of government corruption, and so anesthetized to the sights and sounds of Corporate America marching in lockstep with the police state that few seem to pay heed to the warning signs blaring out the message: Danger Ahead.\u000a\u000aRemember, the Titanic received at least four warnings from other ships about the presence of icebergs in its path, with the last warning issued an hour before disaster struck. All four warnings were ignored.\u000a\u000aLike the Titanic, we\u2019re plowing full steam ahead into a future riddled with hidden and not-so-hidden dangers. We too have been given ample warnings, only to have them drowned out by a carefully choreographed cacophony of political noise, cultural distractions and entertainment news\u2014what the Romans termed \u201cbread and circuses\u201d\u2014aimed at keeping the American people polarized, pacified and easily manipulated.\u000a\u000aHowever, there is still danger ahead. The peril to our republic remains the same.\u000a\u000aAs long as a permanent, unelected bureaucracy\u2014a.k.a. the shadow government\u2014 continues to call the shots in the halls of power and the reach of the police state continues to expand, the crisis has not been averted.\u000a\u000aHere\u2019s a glimpse of some of the nefarious government programs we\u2019ll be encountering on our journey through the treacherous waters of 2017.\u000a\u000aMandatory quarantines without due process or informed consent: Under a new rule proposed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, government agents will be empowered to indefinitely detain any traveler they suspect of posing a medical risk to others without providing an explanation, subject them to medical tests without their consent, and carry out such detentions and quarantines without any kind of due process or judicial review.\u000a\u000aMental health assessments by non-medical personnel: As a result of a nationwide push to train a broad spectrum of so-called gatekeepers such as pastors, teachers, hair stylists, bartenders, police officers and EMTs in mental health first-aid training, more Americans are going to run the risk of being reported by non-medical personnel and detained for having mental health issues.\u000a\u000aTracking chips for citizens: Momentum is building for the government to be able to track citizens, whether through the use of RFID chips embedded in a national ID card or through microscopic chips embedded in one\u2019s skin. In December 2016, the House of Representatives overwhelmingly approved legislation allowing police to track individuals suffering from some form of mental disability such as Alzheimer\u2019s or autism by way of implanted chips.\u000a\u000aMilitary training to deal with anti-establishment movements in megacities: The future, according to a Pentagon training video, will be militaristic, dystopian and far from friendly to freedom. Indeed, if this government propaganda-piece that is being used to train special forces is to be believed, the only thing that can save the world from outright anarchy\u2014in the eyes of the government, at least\u2014is the military working in conjunction with local police. The video confirms what I\u2019ve been warning about for so long: in the eyes of the U.S. government and its henchmen, the battlefield of the future is the American home front.\u000a\u000aGovernment censorship of anything it classifies as disinformation: This year\u2019s National Defense Authorization Act, which allocates $619 billion for war and military spending, not only allows the military to indefinitely detain American citizens by placing them beyond the reach of the Constitution, but it also directs the State Department to establish a national anti-propaganda center to \u201ccounter disinformation and propaganda.\u201d Translation: the government plans to crack down on anyone attempting to exercise their First Amendment rights by exposing government wrongdoing, while persisting in peddling its own brand of fake news.\u000a\u000aThreat assessments: Government agents\u2014with the help of automated eyes and ears, a growing arsenal of high-tech software, hardware and techniques, government propaganda urging Americans to turn into spies and snitches, as well as social media and behavior sensing software\u2014are spinning a sticky spider-web of threat assessments, behavioral sensing warnings, flagged \u201cwords,\u201d and \u201csuspicious\u201d activity reports aimed at snaring potential enemies of the state. It\u2019s the American police state rolled up into one oppressive pre-crime and pre-thought crime package.\u000a\u000aWar on cash: The government and its corporate partners are engaged in a concerted campaign to do away with large bills such as $20s, $50s, $100s and shift consumers towards a digital mode of commerce that can easily be monitored, tracked, tabulated, mined for data, hacked, hijacked and confiscated when convenient. As economist Steve Forbes concludes, \u201cThe real reason for this war on cash\u2014start with the big bills and then work your way down\u2014is an ugly power grab by Big Government. People will have less privacy: Electronic commerce makes it easier for Big Brother to see what we\u2019re doing, thereby making it simpler to bar activities it doesn\u2019t like, such as purchasing salt, sugar, big bottles of soda and Big Macs.\u201d\u000a\u000aExpansive surveillance: Whether you\u2019re walking through a store, driving your car, checking email, or talking to friends and family on the phone, you can be sure that some government agency, whether the NSA or some other entity, will still be listening in and tracking your behavior. This doesn\u2019t even begin to touch on the corporate trackers who work with the government to monitor your purchases, web browsing, Facebook posts and other activities taking place in the cyber sphere. In such an environment, we are all suspects to be spied on, searched, scanned, frisked, monitored, tracked and treated as if we\u2019re potentially guilty of some wrongdoing or other.\u000a\u000aMilitarized police: Americans are finding their once-peaceful communities transformed into military outposts, complete with tanks, weaponry, and other equipment designed for the battlefield. Now, the Department of Homeland Security, the Justice Department and the FBI are preparing to turn the nation\u2019s police officers into techno-warriors, complete with iris scanners, body scanners, thermal imaging Doppler radar devices, facial recognition programs, license plate readers, cell phone extraction software, Stingray devices and so much more.\u000a\u000aPolice shootings of unarmed citizens: Owing in large part to the militarization of local law enforcement agencies, not a week goes by without more reports of hair-raising incidents by police imbued with a take-no-prisoners attitude and a battlefield approach to the communities in which they serve. Indeed, as a special report by The Washington Post reveals, despite heightened awareness of police misconduct, the number of fatal shootings by officers in 2016 remained virtually unchanged from the year before.\u000a\u000aFalse flags and terrorist attacks: Despite the government\u2019s endless propaganda about the threat of terrorism, statistics show that you are 17,600 times more likely to die from heart disease than from a terrorist attack. You are 11,000 times more likely to die from an airplane accident than from a terrorist plot involving an airplane. You are 1,048 times more likely to die from a car accident than a terrorist attack. You are 404 times more likely to die in a fall than from a terrorist attack. And you are 8 times more likely to be killed by a police officer than by a terrorist.\u000a\u000aEndless wars to keep America\u2019s military\u2019s empire employed: The military industrial complex that has advocated that the U.S. remain at war, year after year, is the very entity that will continue to profit the most from America\u2019s expanding military empire. The U.S. Department of Defense is the world\u2019s largest employer, with more than 3.2 million employees. Thus far, the U.S. taxpayer has been made to shell out more than $1.6 trillion to wage wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. When you add in military efforts in Pakistan, as well as the lifetime price of health care for disabled veterans and interest on the national debt, that cost rises to $4.4 trillion.\u000a\u000aAttempts by the government to identify, target and punish so-called domestic \u201cextremists\u201d: The government\u2019s anti-extremism program will, in many cases, be utilized to render otherwise lawful, nonviolent activities as potentially extremist. To this end, police will identify, monitor and deter individuals who exhibit, express or engage in anything that could be construed as extremist before they can become actual threats. This is pre-crime on an ideological scale.\u000a\u000aSWAT team raids: More than 80% of American communities have their own SWAT teams, with more than 80,000 of these paramilitary raids are carried out every year. That translates to more than 200 SWAT team raids every day in which police crash through doors, damage private property, kill citizens, terrorize adults and children alike, kill family pets, assault or shoot anyone that is perceived as threatening\u2014and most often in the pursuit of someone merely suspected of a crime, usually some small amount of drugs.\u000a\u000aErosions of private property: Private property means little at a time when SWAT teams and other government agents can invade your home, break down your doors, kill your dog, wound or kill you, damage your furnishings and terrorize your family. Likewise, if government officials can fine and arrest you for growing vegetables in your front yard, praying with friends in your living room, installing solar panels on your roof, and raising chickens in your backyard, you\u2019re no longer the owner of your property.\u000a\u000aOvercriminalization: The government\u2019s tendency towards militarization and overcriminalization, in which routine, everyday behaviors become targets of regulation and prohibition, has resulted in Americans getting arrested for making and selling unpasteurized goat cheese, cultivating certain types of orchids, feeding a whale, holding Bible studies in their homes, and picking their kids up from school.\u000a\u000aStrip searches and the denigration of bodily integrity: Court rulings undermining the Fourth Amendment and justifying invasive strip searches have left us powerless against police empowered to forcefully draw our blood, forcibly take our DNA, strip search us, and probe us intimately. Accounts are on the rise of individuals\u2014men and women alike\u2014being subjected to what is essentially government-sanctioned rape by police in the course of \u201croutine\u201d traffic stops.\u000a\u000aDrones: As corporations and government agencies alike prepare for their part in the coming drone invasion\u2014it is expected that at least 30,000 drones will occupy U.S. airspace by 2020, ushering in a $30 billion per year industry\u2014it won\u2019t be long before American citizens find themselves to be the target of these devices. Drones\u2014unmanned aerial vehicles\u2014will come in all shapes and sizes, from nano-sized drones as small as a grain of sand that can do everything from conducting surveillance to detonating explosive charges, to middle-sized copter drones that can deliver pizzas to massive \u201chunter/killer\u201d Predator warships that unleash firepower from on high.\u000a\u000aPrisons: America\u2019s prisons, housing the largest number of inmates in the world and still growing, have become money-making enterprises for private corporations that manage the prisons in exchange for the states agreeing to maintain a 90% occupancy rate for at least 20 years. And how do you keep the prisons full? By passing laws aimed at increasing the prison population, including the imposition of life sentences on people who commit minor or nonviolent crimes such as siphoning gasoline.\u000a\u000aCensorship: First Amendment activities are being pummeled, punched, kicked, choked, chained and generally gagged all across the country. Free speech zones, bubble zones, trespass zones, anti-bullying legislation, zero tolerance policies, hate crime laws and a host of other legalistic maladies dreamed up by politicians and prosecutors have conspired to corrode our core freedoms. The reasons for such censorship vary widely from political correctness, safety concerns and bullying to national security and hate crimes but the end result remains the same: the complete eradication of what Benjamin Franklin referred to as the \u201cprincipal pillar of a free government.\u201d\u000a\u000aFascism: As a Princeton University survey indicates, our elected officials, especially those in the nation\u2019s capital, represent the interests of the rich and powerful rather than the average citizen. We are no longer a representative republic. With Big Business and Big Government having fused into a corporate state, the president and his state counterparts\u2014the governors\u2014have become little more than CEOs of the Corporate State, which day by day is assuming more government control over our lives. Never before have average Americans had so little say in the workings of their government and even less access to their so-called representatives.\u000a\u000aJames Madison, the father of the Constitution, put it best when he warned: \u201cTake alarm at the first experiment with liberties.\u201d Anyone with even a casual knowledge about current events knows that the first experiment on our freedoms happened long ago.\u000a\u000aWe are fast moving past the point of no return when it comes to restoring our freedoms. Worse, as I make clear in my book Battlefield America: The War on the American People, we can barely see the old America with its revolutionary principles and value for independence in the rear view mirror. The only reality emerging generations will know is the one constructed for them by the powers-that-be, and you can rest assured that it will not be a reality that favors individuality, liberty or anything or anyone who challenges the status quo.\u000a\u000aAs a senior advisor to George W. Bush observed, \u201cWe\u2019re an empire now, and when we act, we create our own reality. And while you\u2019re studying that reality\u2014judiciously, as you will\u2014we\u2019ll act again, creating other new realities, which you can study too, and that\u2019s how things will sort out. We\u2019re history\u2019s actors . . . and you, all of you, will be left to just study what we do.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn other words, the government has been operating ten steps ahead for quite some time now, and we have yet to catch up, let alone catch our breath as the tides of change swirl around us.\u000a\u000aYou\u2019d better tighten your seatbelts, folks, because we could be in for a rough ride in 2017.\u000a\u000aRead more at: rutherford.org

To this end, police will identify, monitor and deter individuals who exhibit, express or engage in anything that could be construed as extremist before they can become actual threats.&#160;This is pre-crime on an ideological scale.</p>\u000a<p><strong>SWAT team raids:&#160;</strong>More than&#160;<a href="http://www.salon.com/2014/08/14/one_nation_under_swat_how_americas_police_became_an_occupying_force_partner/" target="_blank">80% of American communities have their own SWAT teams</a>, with more than 80,000 of these paramilitary raids are carried out every year. That translates to more than 200 SWAT team raids every day in which police crash through doors, damage private property, kill citizens, terrorize adults and children alike, kill family pets, assault or shoot anyone that is perceived as threatening&#8212;and most often in the pursuit of someone merely&#160;suspected&#160;of a crime,&#160;<a href="http://www.salon.com/2014/08/14/one_nation_under_swat_how_americas_police_became_an_occupying_force_partner/" target="_blank">usually some small amount of drugs</a>.</p>\u000a<p><strong>Erosions of private property:&#160;</strong><a href="http://www.standard.net/Guest-Commentary/2015/01/07/Limits-on-freedom-to-use-private-property-rights" target="_blank">Private property means little at a time when SWAT teams and other government agents can invade your home, break down your doors, kill your dog, wound or kill you, damage your furnishings and terrorize your family</a>.

Drones&#8212;unmanned aerial vehicles&#8212;will come in all shapes and sizes, from nano-sized drones as small as a grain of sand that can do everything from conducting surveillance to detonating explosive charges, to middle-sized copter drones that can deliver pizzas to massive &#8220;hunter/killer&#8221; Predator warships that unleash firepower from on high.</p>\u000a<p><strong>Prisons:</strong>&#160;America&#8217;s prisons, housing&#160;<a href="http://www.newsweek.com/americas-correctional-system-numbers-293583" target="_blank">the largest number of inmates in the world and still growing</a>, have become&#160;<a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/the-prison-industry-in-the-united-states-big-business-or-a-new-form-of-slavery/8289" target="_blank">money-making enterprises for private corporations</a>&#160;that manage the prisons in exchange for the states agreeing to maintain a 90% occupancy rate for at least 20 years.

The reasons for such censorship vary widely from political correctness, safety concerns and bullying to national security and hate crimes but the end result remains the same: the complete eradication of what Benjamin Franklin referred to as the &#8220;<a href="http://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/2015/01/16/history/great-american-thinkers-free-speech.html" target="_blank">principal pillar of a free government</a>.&#8221;</p>\u000a<p><strong>Fascism:&#160;</strong>As a Princeton University survey indicates,&#160;<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/10769041/The-US-is-an-oligarchy-study-concludes.html" target="_blank">our elected officials, especially those in the nation&#8217;s capital, represent the interests of the rich and powerful</a>&#160;rather than the average citizen. We are no longer a representative republic. With Big Business and Big Government having fused into a corporate state, the president and his state counterparts&#8212;the governors&#8212;have become little more than CEOs of the Corporate State, which day by day is assuming more government control over our lives. Never before have average Americans had so little say in the workings of their government and even less access to their so-called representatives.</p>\u000a<p>James Madison, the father of the Constitution, put it best when he warned: &#8220;Take alarm at the first experiment with liberties.&#8221; Anyone with even a casual knowledge about current events knows that the first experiment on our freedoms happened long ago.</p>\u000a<p>We are fast moving past the point of no return when it comes to restoring our freedoms.

V(Natural News) A gene that confers resistance to colistin, the \u201cantibiotic of last resort,\u201d is alarmingly widespread in China, according to two separate studies published in The Lancet on January 27.\u000a\u000aThe drug-resistance gene in question, MCR-1 was first identified in China in 2015, in Escherichia coli (more commonly known as E. coli) bacteria in pigs, pork, and a handful of human patients. Since then, the gene has turned up in 30 other countries, including the United States. It renders bacteria immune to one of the few antibiotics that can still be used against multidrug resistant superbugs.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is a warning shot about the possible scenario where we don\u2019t have very much left in the armory to treat infections,\u201d said Nigel Brown of Britain\u2019s Microbiology Society.\u000a\u000aGene already spreading to superbugs\u000a\u000aIn the first study, researchers collected more than 17,000 samples from patients with gut bacteria infections at two hospitals in Zhejiang and Guangdong from 2007 to 2015. Overall, they found that about 1 percent of the infectious bacteria sampled contained the MCR-1 gene. The gene was more common in E. coli, with a frequency of 1.4 percent. Notably, the prevalence of MCR-1 in E. coli increased over the study period.\u000a\u000aThe researchers found that people with a recent history of antibiotic use were significantly more likely to be infected with MCR-1 positive E. coli. There was no increased risk associated with living near a farm, even though colistin has been widely used in Chinese agriculture. This suggests that MCR-1 is likely spreading between bacteria, rather than MCR-1 positive bacteria merely spreading through asexual reproduction.\u000a\u000aThis mode of transmission is particularly worrisome because it is faster and also makes it more likely that MCR-1 will cross to other strains and species of bacteria, including those already resistant to other antibiotics. This could easily produce a superbug resistant to all known human antibiotics.\u000a\u000aThis has already started occurring in China, the second study found. In that study, researchers screened more than 2,000 bacterial samples from bloodstream infection patients at 28 Chinese hospitals from 2013 to 2014. They found that about 1.3 percent of E. coli samples were positive for MCR-1; a similar rate to the first study. This indicated that MCR-1 has already spread across China, and may be spreading through contaminated medical equipment.\u000a\u000aSignificantly, many of the positive samples were of a strain known as ST131, which is already multidrug resistant. E. coli ST131 is a major cause of urinary tract infections worldwide.\u000a\u000a\u201cNightmare bacteria\u201d in our future\u000a\u000aMany researchers have blamed the rapid spread of MCR-1 on China\u2019s widespread use of colistin as a growth-promoter for livestock. China finally banned the drug from animal feed in 2016, but it may be too late to stop the gene\u2019s spread. And while MCR-1 remains relatively rare in bacteria that infect humans, the bacterial ability to swap DNA between unrelated species likely makes it only a matter of time before the gene crosses to more common human infectious agents.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt now looks like there\u2019s potential for the resistance gene to move around and spread between different species of bacteria,\u201d Brown said.\u000a\u000aAnd now that colistin has been approved in China for human use, the spread of colistin-resistance is expected to accelerate.\u000a\u000aA preview of what this might look like came in August, when the CDC analyzed samples of the Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteria that had killed a 70-year-old Reno woman from blood poisoning. They found that the bacteria were resistant to all 26 antibiotics approved for use in human beings, including \u201ccolistin.\u201d The CDC dubbed the strain a \u201cnightmare bacteria.\u201d\u000a\u000aExperts are warning with increasing urgency that unless dramatic changes are made to antibiotic prescribing practices, including curtailing the use of drugs in agriculture, we may soon enter a post-antibiotic era. This would render currently routine medical procedures such as surgery and cancer treatment so unsafe as to be impossible.\u000a\u000aSources for this article include:\u000a\u000aSputnikNews.com\u000a\u000aNaturalNews.com

V(Natural News) It\u2019s no secret that air pollution is on the rise across the globe, especially in cities. In fact, a 2016 report from the World Health Organization indicated that outdoor pollution had risen by 8 percent in just five years.\u000a\u000aBeyond its environmental effects, air pollution is known for being harmful to the respiratory and circulatory systems. Toxic air pollutants like sulfates, nitrates, and black carbon can penetrate deep into lung and cardiovascular tissues, which poses a serious risk to human health. Outdoor air pollution is regarded as the top single killer in the world \u2014 causing up to 3 million deaths per year.\u000a\u000aNow, new research has shown that the hazardous effects don\u2019t stop there: air pollution is bad for the brain, too. The study, led by researchers from the University of Southern California, found that air pollution raises the risk of dementia by up to 92 percent \u2014 thanks to toxic particles that cause brain swelling. Even if the air doesn\u2019t kill you, it will make you sick one way or another.\u000a\u000aAir pollution harms the brain, too\u000a\u000aThe toxic fumes from cars and power plants are actually infiltrating brain cells, which leads to swelling. In turn, this leads to an increased risk of dementia, experts say. In fact, air pollution may actually be behind the rising incidence of dementia. Epidemiologist Jiu-Chiuan Chen of the Keck School of Medicine at USC, the study\u2019s lead author, says that if their findings hold up for the rest of population, it would suggest that air pollution is related to about 21 percent of all dementia cases across the world.\u000a\u000aThe Californian research team analyzed data from 3,647 women who were between the ages of 65 and 79, and did not have dementia. Their 11-year epidemiological study was the first of its kind to be conducted in the United States and was published by the journal Translational Psychiatry. [Related: Learn more about the latest scientific research at Scientific.news]\u000a\u000aWhat the researchers found was that women who lived in heavily polluted areas, such as near main roads or in busy cities, had a dramatic increase in their risk for cognitive decline \u2014 to the tune of 81 percent. Being exposed to levels of pollution deemed unsafe by health officials also translated to a 92 percent greater risk of developing dementia.\u000a\u000aThe team also discovered that certain women may be more at risk than others. Women who carried the APOE4 gene \u2014 which increases the risk of Alzheimer\u2019s disease \u2014 exhibited the highest risk of getting dementia.\u000a\u000aProfessor Caleb Finch, who co-authored the study, explained, \u201cMicroscopic particles generated by fossil fuels get into our body directly through the nose into the brain.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cCells in the brain treat these particles as invaders and react with inflammatory responses, which over the course of time, appear to exacerbate and promote Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\u201d\u000a\u000aFinch says that while the link between air pollution and Alzheimer\u2019s disease and other types of dementia is still a \u201cnew frontier,\u201d evidence continues to show that pollution is harmful to an aging brain. [Related: Keep up with the latest headlines about healthy aging at Longevity.news]\u000a\u000aPrevious research shows similar findings\u000a\u000aPrevious research has also shown a correlation between air pollution and dementia risk. For example, earlier this year Canadian researchers unveiled their own findings that suggested air pollution is harmful to the brain. The team found that living within 50 meters of a main road were 12% more likely to develop dementia. In such close proximity, the levels of fine pollutant particles are up to 10 times higher than they are at even just a slightly further distance of 150 meters.\u000a\u000aIn 2015, an analysis of MRI brain scans from individuals that had enrolled in the Framingham Heart Study also came up with some concerning findings. The researchers from Harvard Medical School discovered that the closer people lived to a major roadway (and the more pollution they\u2019d been exposed to), the smaller their cerebral brain volume was. This association remained even after the scientists adjusted for other factors like smoking, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.\u000a\u000aWhile the study of air pollution\u2019s effects on the brain may be new, these recent findings certainly demand attention.\u000a\u000aSources:\u000a\u000aDailyMail.co.uk\u000a\u000aTheGuardian.com\u000a\u000aScienceMag.org

V(Natural News) We first want to thank Fox News for FINALLY reporting on a subject that has been highly censored by the mainstream media for the past 5+ years, the situation in Fukushima, Japan is completely out of control. While Fox News recently reported that radiation levels at Fukushima were now at \u2018unimaginable levels\u2019 more than 5 years after the disastrous earthquake and tsunami struck, as Steve Quayle asked in an SQNote he left while linking to that story, why has the mainstream media been silent all of this time?\u000a\u000a(Article by Stefan Stanford from Allnewspipeline.com)\u000a\u000aWe\u2019ve long believed that \u2018reality\u2019 has a way of \u2018awakening\u2019 everybody and the stories recently coming across the wire over at ENENews have been mind-numbing the last few weeks to say the least. You can hear the Fox News report on Fukushima in the 1st video below while in the 2nd video, Mike Adams over at Natural News gives us a new update on the \u2018Fukushima radiation apocalypse\u2019 that has been steadily spewing poisons into our atmosphere for almost 6 years now with hardly a peep from the MSM.\u000a\u000aIn the most recent stories from ENENews, on February 5th they reported the heartbreaking news that a record high number of whale deaths had recently been reported surrounding the Hawaiian Islands with the sick and starving animals allegedly a \u2018mystery\u2019 to experts. Reporting that rotting carcasses were scattered throughout the islands, how can so-called experts NOT know that Fukushima poisons flowing into our oceans for years are most likely to blame?\u000a\u000aAs Adams tells us in his video, the sustainability of all life throughout the Northern hemisphere is in danger and the entire MSM up until now has been in a complete blackout mode except for this recent reports. Do CNN, MSNBC and the rest of them think that if they DON\u2019T report upon Fukushima, what\u2019s happening to the fish and our oceans is \u2018fake news\u2019? Do they think that because we can\u2019t actually SEE the radiation, it\u2019s not really there? The MSM\u2019s failure to report upon Fukushima may be the final straw that not only breaks the camel\u2019s back but puts that camel out of our misery.\u000a\u000aFor the past several years, we\u2019ve reported horror story after horror story of sea life dying all across the Pacific Ocean and up and down the entire West coast, from Alaska to California. Also documented in great detail over the past several years by ENENews, with mass animal deaths all across the world being kept track of by End Times Prophecy, it\u2019s clear that the mainstream media has completely failed the American public on Fukushima.\u000a\u000aAnother recent story over at ENENews reports on Fox News\u2019 sudden admission that Fukushima is out of control, highlighting a few phrases used by Fox in their report that shows just how completely out of touch the MSM has been with reality over the past 5+ years. Their story also brings to light :\u000a\u000aFox News, Feb 8, 2017 (emphasis added): Adam Housley, who reported from the area in 2011 following the catastrophic triple-meltdown, said this morning that new fuel leaks have been discovered\u2026 He said that critics, including the U.S. military in 2011, have long questioned whether Tokyo Electric Power Co. (TEPCO) and officials have been providing accurate information on the severity of the radiation\u2026 He added that critics are now questioning whether the radiation has been this severe all along.\u000a\u000aFox News video transcript excerpts, Feb 8, 2017: \u201cExperts believe melted fuel is leaking inside the plant almost daily\u2026 No one knew [in 2011] of the growing threat which today only continues to get worse\u2026 Wow, this is a crazy story\u2026 What some people are saying is, \u2018 Has it been this bad since the beginning?\u2019\u201d\u000a\u000aQuite surprisingly after all of their years of silence, the Washington Post actually finally reported on Fukushima on February 8th in a story in which they asked: \u201cCould the radiation level be even higher? Possibly. The 530 sievert reading was recorded some distance from the melted fuel, so in reality it could be 10 times higher than recorded\u201d said Hideyuki Ban, co-director of Citizens\u2019 Nuclear Information Center.\u000a\u000aImagine that\u2026 ten times higher than the \u2018unimaginable levels\u2019 already detected. Is this why the MSM is finally reporting upon Fukushima? As a commenter on the Washington Post story wisely mentions, we\u2019re watching a run-a-way train speeding completely out of control and experts have admitted, there is really no way to stop it\u2026 and least not in the next several decades.\u000a\u000aDevastating to our oceans and therefore our food chain, we read in the new SQAlert seen below that most Americans are completely clueless to what is happening to the Pacific Ocean and up and down the West Coast of America.\u000a\u000aREADERS RESPONSE TO FUKUSHIMA, AND ITS DAILY AND DEADLY EFFECTS, IN TRYING TO GET HIS FRIENDS TO CONSIDER THE RAMIFICATIONS TO THEM!\u000a\u000aRegarding this forever-lied-about Fukushima tonnage released daily, the problem is two-fold\u2014 1) only a small (yet growing) number of dumbed-down, Facebook and Twitter-absorbed, McDonald\u2019s food-engorging people are even AWARE\u2026..yes, after five years\u2026..of how serious Fukushima is. It is because the mainstream media doesn\u2019t breathe a word about it. 2) the second issue is RAMPANT APATHY, RESIGNATION, AND DENIAL. I sent the bleak and depressing coast-of-Chile sardine kill photos to friends everywhere and not even ONE (we are talking about people your age and mine\u2026.about 65\u2026.highly successful and intelligent) wrote me back with perhaps a query as to whether it MUST BE radiation from Fukushima or if it MIGHT HOPEFULLY BE El Nino algae \u201cred bloom\u201d choking off oxygen.\u000a\u000aONLY A HANDFULL\u2026.REALLY CARE. THE WORD I AM LOOKING FOR IS FATALISM. DAVID C. (MY RESPONSE \u2013 SQ DENIAL UNTO DESTRUCTION \u2013 FATALISM USUALLY DEALS WITH FUTILITY AND HELPLESSNESS TO AN OVERWHELMING EVENT OR DISASTER -THIS IS THE WILLING ABANDONMENT, OF REASON AND PERCEPTION \u2013 NICE WAY OF DISMISSING YOU AND THE SERIOUS NATURE OF THE INFORMATION YOU SENT THEM! \u2014 THEIR ATTITUDE IS FORGET ABOUT IT \u2013 MY ADVICE TO YOU FORGET ABOUT THEM UNLESS THE LORD TELLS YOU DIFFERENTLY)\u000a\u000aAnd the ignorance of the American people in itself is the work of the MSM, neglecting to report upon what could be the most important health story in America and the northern hemisphere today \u2013 a story that up until now, has flown completely under the MSM radar. So why would the MSM \u2018black out\u2019 Fukushima for nearly 6 years and why are they suddenly reporting upon what\u2019s happening there now?\u000a\u000aIn the new story from Mike Adams over at Natural News he reports \u201cthere are times when I\u2019m convinced humanity is a suicidal cult of complete idiots whose only real achievement is figuring out increasingly obscene ways to distract themselves from reality.\u201d Adams points out that while most of the nation was fixated on the Super Bowl and Lady Gaga, the Fukushima disaster got much worse\u2026and the MSM remained silent.\u000a\u000aIn the new story from Ethan Huff over at Outbreak.News he reports that according to one liberal college professor, the world will be much better off without 90% of the population. Professor Eric Pianka from the University of Texas claims the Earth is way overdue for a massive die-off. And with much of the left thinking murdering babies is ok, as is \u2018expressing their love through violence upon those who don\u2019t think like they do\u2019, might Fukushima be the \u2018ultimate depopulation weapon\u2019, intentionally unleashed upon \u2018the West\u2019, an endless radiological attack upon the Northern hemisphere, one we cannot see nor smell nor taste?\u000a\u000aThe fact that the mainstream media has seemingly gone out of their way to cover up what has been happening at Fukushima for almost 6 years now gives us a hint that something much more might be at play. And the fact that liberal professors such as Eric Pianka seemingly have a death wish for our society should prove to us what kind of people have gained power over the past decade+, and that have led to snowflakes suffering nuclear meltdowns on US college campuses. From Outbreak.News:\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is really an exciting time,\u201d Pianka is quoted as saying amid warnings of an apocalyptic future. \u201cDeath. This is what awaits us all. Death.\u201d\u000a\u000aPianka\u2019s collective death wish for humanity fits right into the current eugenics plan of limitless abortion, which has become a rallying cry of the political left. Just recently, millions of women marched on Washington, D.C., to demand that they continue having access to abortion clinics where they can murder their unborn babies on a whim \u2014 because this is supposedly their right as women.\u000a\u000aSuch evil is exactly the type of thing that Pianka seems to embrace as good in his distorted worldview. Killing off humans is a good thing in his demented mind, and this message of human destruction is continually being spread to impressionable young men and women attending college who likely never thought they would encounter this toxic message while trying to get an education.\u000a\u000aAfter making his initial statements in front of a diverse crowd at the Texas Academy of Sciences, Pianka was later approached by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) after being reported as a potential terrorist.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIn the final video below, Alex Jones from Infowars talks with us about Fukushima and the massive mainstream news media blackout and coverup that has been going for 5+ years, comparing what\u2019s happening at Fukushima to climate change and global warming while proving to us the MSM has an \u2018agenda\u2019, while asking: \u201cwhat are they still hiding?\u201d\u000a\u000aRead more at: Allnewspipeline.com

VOne of the far-left \u201canti-fascist\u201d groups behind last week\u2019s riot in Berkeley, Refuse Fascism, received $50,000 from a group backed by socialist billionaire George Soros, according to the Daily Caller.\u000a\u000a(Article by Charlie Nash from Breitbart.com)\u000a\u000aThe Alliance for Global Justice, which is funded by the George Soros-backed Tides Foundation, reportedly donated $50,000 to fund Refuse Fascism, which openly brags about using violence to shut down conservative and libertarian speech.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhile it is unclear whether those who carried out the violence were paid to do so, the benefactors of the Alliance for Global Justice \u2014 and Refuse Fascism \u2014 are listed online,\u201d reported the Daily Caller. \u201cAccording to its most recent 990 tax form, Alliance for Global Justice (AfGJ) received $2.2 million in funding for the fiscal year ending in March 2016. One of the group\u2019s biggest donors is the Tides Foundation, a non-profit funded by billionaire progressive philanthropist George Soros. Tides gave AfGJ $50,000.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOther notable donors include the city of Tucson and the United Steel Workers labor union.

Patagonia.org, the outdoor apparel and equipment company, gave $40,000. The Ben & Jerry Foundation, the charity associated with the ice cream maker, gave $20,000. And Lush Cosmetic gave $43,950. Another bit of irony is seen in the $5,000 contribution from the Peace Development Fund, a group that claims to support organizations that fight for human rights and social justice.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe group defended the violent riot at Berkeley on Facebook, which left numerous Trump supporters and fans of MILO injured and bloody, before deleting their post.\u000a\u000a\u201cDismantling police fences is not violent,\u201d they claimed, according to the Daily Caller, ignoring the rest of the violence that occured. \u201cAnd to compare preventing someone like that from speaking to the real-world violence that they perpetuate everyday is ludicrous.\u201d\u000a\u000aRefuse Fascism also branded the riot as \u201crighteous,\u201d and encouraged more violence to shut down conservatives in a post on their website.\u000a\u000a\u201cLast night, thousands of students, professors and others protested the appearance and organizing rally of Milo Yiannopoulos, a major fascist operative, shutting it down.

VWith winter on our doorstep, many of us end up with a nasty cold or cough. While most people run to the store for over-the-counter meds packed with artificial dyes and chemicals, I prefer to go all-natural and avoid the harmful side effects of commercially available cough syrups.\u000a\u000aYou would be surprised of how many natural remedies are in your pantry right now. Pineapple juice is one of these wonderful healing ingredients to soothe a persistent cough or sore throat.\u000a\u000aIn 2010 Indian researchers tested the effectiveness of natural substances such as pineapple juice to treat tuberculosis (find the study here). They found that a mixture of pineapple juice with raw honey, pepper and salt work extremely well to dissolve mucus and soothe a persistent cough. Patients recovered up to 5 times quicker with this all natural pineapple remedy compared to OTC cough syrup.\u000a\u000aBenefits Of Pineapple Juice\u000a\u000aPineapple thanks its many health benefits to a powerful enzyme called bromelain which acts as an antioxidant to reduce inflammation and swelling of the sinuses. It eliminates bacteria and fights infections.\u000a\u000aOnly 1 cup of pure pineapple juice contains 50% of your daily recommendation of vitamin C, another powerful antioxidant to strengthen your immune system and soothe a sore throat or cough.\u000a\u000aNext to bromalain and vitamin C, pineapple is also a good source of vitamin A, thiamin, riboflavin, vitamin B-6, folate, pantothenic acid, magnesium, manganese and potassium, which are all essential nutrients to keep your body healthy.\u000a\u000aPowerful All-natural Cough Suppressant Recipe\u000a\u000aIf you have a juicer it is best to make your own juice, or opt for unprocessed natural pineapple juice instead.

VHolistic Foods With Amazing Amino Acid Benefits

VWhen going vegan or vegetarian, most people relish in the antioxidant, rich mineral, and vitamin benefits that their newfound veggie-filled lifestyle is about to bestow them. They have good reason \u2013 scientists have long since found that vegetarians and vegans are generally healthier:\u000a\u000aPlant-based diets lower body mass index (BMI).\u000a\u000aPlant-based diets lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels.\u000a\u000aPlant-based diets lower the amount of pharmaceuticals needed to treat diseases.\u000a\u000aPlant-based diets lower ischemic cardiac disease death rates.\u000a\u000aVegetarians have lower rates of diabetes and obesity. (Nonvegetarians are 74 percent more likely to develop diabetes within 17 years than vegetarians.)\u000a\u000aOn average, vegetarians take in more magnesium, iron, folate, potassium, riboflavin, thiamin, and vitamins.\u000a\u000aBut what\u2019s often ignored or unnoticed are the holistic benefits that amino acids offer, since the concentration is on the wealth of newfound veggies and less on protein.\u000a\u000aIf you\u2019re about to go on a plant-based diet for the long term, you might think you\u2019re not like less educated people who dive in and end up malnourished. You know proteins are important for your body and you\u2019re planning on sourcing them from legumes, mushrooms, nuts, soy, and other clean, protein-rich plant sources. But no matter how you look at it, meat, eggs, and poultry have more protein than plant-based proteins.\u000a\u000aResearchers say that quinoa, brown rice with beans, and hummus with whole wheat pita are top plant-based sources for essential amino acids that your body needs but can\u2019t make (unlike nonessential amino acids). But you shouldn\u2019t strive for just your daily protein requirement. The many amino acids in proteins give you many amazing benefits when you take enough of them.\u000a\u000aHere are some creative and exotic ways you can get more plant-based amino acids, and the wonderful holistic benefits they\u2019ll give your body:\u000a\u000a1. Drink Cashew or Almond Milk to Detox Your Body\u000a\u000aDoctors often recommend boosting intake of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) in liver failure or liver injury patients because they boost the liver\u2019s ability to detoxify ammonia, and because the liver\u2019s BCAA stores are noticeably depleted if cirrhosis is present. Taking in more BCAAs with a healthy liver means you\u2019ll be supercharging your liver\u2019s detox properties.\u000a\u000aAmino acids can also help detox your body if you\u2019re going through drug withdrawal. According to Dr. Tarugu, M.D., who specializes in addiction recovery treatment, chronic drug and alcohol abuse lead to an imbalance of neurotransmitters in the brain. This imbalance plays a role in substance cravings. When amino acids are administered to rehab patients, they report a lessening in cravings after three days of the therapy.\u000a\u000aA great source of BCAAs and other amino acids are cashew and almond milks. A glass of either nut milk gives you over 5 grams of BCAAs and even more in other amino acids.\u000a\u000a2. Enjoy Kimchi, Chongkukjang, Doenjang and other Exotic Korean Fermented Dishes and Boost Your Immunity\u000a\u000aResearchers found that your intestines and the lymphoid tissue surrounding them (collectively known as GALT) are one of your immune system\u2019s largest defense front lines. They say GALT is your largest immune organ and serves many vital major functions, including the major defender and barrier against oral pathogens coming from your mouth, keeping balance with your good bacteria (teaching the immune system to ignore them), sorting out normal food particles from potentially toxic particles you\u2019ve ingested, and acting as a \u201cschool\u201d for baby T and B immune cells where they mature by exposing them to various antigens and then leave to defend other parts of your body.\u000a\u000aBut, if you don\u2019t have enough protein, researchers found that your immune system becomes suppressed. They also say that protein malnutrition is the top cause for immune deficiency worldwide. They play a huge role in your GALT\u2019s immune capacities. The amino acid glutamine maintains the integrity of your gut barrier. In fact, supplementation with glutamine has been found to help with E. coli infections. It also boosts the proliferation and gene expression of various immune cells in your gut.\u000a\u000aThe amino acid glutamate is used primarily by your intestinal epithelial cells for energy and it\u2019s also vital for the function of immune cells in your GALT. Researchers found that your B cells and mononuclear cells make more antibodies when you supplement with glutamate. They also found that glutamate regulates your T cells in your gut.\u000a\u000aSupplementing with the amino acid arginine has been found to lower bad bacteria counts in your gut, increase the height of your intestine\u2019s villi (which are responsible for nutrient absorption), and lower intestinal damage by bad bacteria infection (like E.coli).\u000a\u000aThe amino acids threonine, methionine, and cysteine have also been found to boost your immune cell count, increase your villi height, and strengthen your gut\u2019s integrity.\u000a\u000aAccording to S. Korea, most Korean fermented foods are soy-based. Soybeans are high in protein, with 1.24 grams of threonine, 0.39 grams of methionine, and 2.22 grams of arginine in one cup. But during the fermentation process, the amino acids convert into free form, which make them more bioavailable since free form amino acids bypass the liver and enter your bloodstream ready for use (non-free amino acids must be digested by your gut and broken down into free amino acids by your liver\u2019s and pancreas\u2019s enzymes before capable of being used).\u000a\u000aS. Korea says that chongkukjang and doenjang are two well-fermented soy dishes. They\u2019re made by boiling soybeans followed by fermentation ceremonies that last from days to months! The result are different aged soybean pastes with more bioavailable amino acids delivered in an exotic delicacy that you can use with salad dressing, in soup broths, or as a dip for chips.\u000a\u000aBesides making amino acids more available, S. Korea says their extensive fermentation processes enrich them with healthy scores of probiotics that boost your immunity, relieve allergies, and heal your gut. Doenjang even has anti-obesity properties \u2013 researchers found that people who eat it daily lose fat in prone areas without additional exercise or dieting. Doenjang has also been found to suppress your appetite and delay aging by protecting your DNA from harmful free radicals.\u000a\u000aYou can also try ganjang and gochujang, which are two other Korean soybean fermented dishes that researchers found have holistic benefits.\u000a\u000aIf you prefer the popular kimchi, which is another Korean fermented dish made with various vegetables, it gives you a fair amount of amino acids too. Its main ingredient is Chinese cabbage, which has significant amounts of the two GALT-essential amino acids threonine and arginine, along with other healthy amino acids and nutrients.\u000a\u000a3. Snack on Bulgarian Yogurt to Help Prevent and Alleviate Sleep Apnea\u000a\u000aHuntington College of Health Sciences says that taking BCAAs helps prevent and lessen sleep apnea. The increase in supply of amino acids regulates your brain\u2019s neurotransmitter levels, which researchers found gives your brain better control of your respiratory function while you sleep.\u000a\u000aYogurt is surprisingly rich in amino acids!

V<div><p>When going vegan or vegetarian, most people relish in the antioxidant, rich mineral, and vitamin benefits that their newfound veggie-filled lifestyle is about to bestow them. They have good reason &#8211; <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3662288/">scientists </a>have long since found that vegetarians and vegans are generally healthier:</p>\u000a<ul>\u000a<li>Plant-based diets lower body mass index (BMI).</li>\u000a<li>Plant-based diets lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels.</li>\u000a<li>Plant-based diets lower the amount of pharmaceuticals needed to treat diseases.</li>\u000a<li>Plant-based diets lower ischemic cardiac disease death rates.</li>\u000a<li>Vegetarians have lower rates of diabetes and obesity. (Nonvegetarians are 74 percent more likely to develop diabetes within 17 years than vegetarians.)</li>\u000a<li>On average, vegetarians take in more magnesium, iron, folate, potassium, riboflavin, thiamin, and vitamins.</li>\u000a</ul>\u000a<p>But what&#8217;s often ignored or unnoticed are the holistic benefits that amino acids offer, since the concentration is on the wealth of newfound veggies and less on protein.</p>\u000a<p>If you&#8217;re about to go on a plant-based diet for the long term, you might think you&#8217;re not like less educated people who dive in and end up malnourished. You know proteins are important for your body and you&#8217;re planning on sourcing them from legumes, mushrooms, nuts, soy, and other clean, protein-rich plant sources. But no matter how you look at it, meat, eggs, and poultry have more protein than plant-based proteins.</p>\u000a<p>Researchers say that quinoa, brown rice with beans, and hummus with whole wheat pita are top plant-based sources for essential amino acids that your body needs but can&#8217;t make (unlike nonessential amino acids). But you shouldn&#8217;t strive for just your daily protein requirement. The many amino acids in proteins give you many amazing benefits when you take enough of them.</p>\u000a<p>Here are some creative and exotic ways you can get more plant-based amino acids, and the wonderful holistic benefits they&#8217;ll give your body:</p>\u000a<h2>1. Drink Cashew or Almond Milk to Detox Your Body</h2>\u000a<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23756281">Doctors </a>often recommend boosting intake of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) in liver failure or liver injury patients because they boost the liver&#8217;s ability to detoxify ammonia, and because the liver&#8217;s BCAA stores are noticeably depleted if cirrhosis is present. Taking in more BCAAs with a healthy liver means you&#8217;ll be supercharging your liver&#8217;s detox properties.</p>\u000a<p>Amino acids can also <a href="http://detoxofsouthflorida.com/category/amino-acids/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">help detox your body</a> if you&#8217;re going through drug withdrawal. According to Dr. Tarugu, M.D., who specializes in addiction recovery treatment, chronic drug and alcohol abuse lead to an imbalance of neurotransmitters in the brain. This imbalance plays a role in substance cravings. When amino acids are administered to rehab patients, they report a lessening in cravings after three days of the therapy.</p>\u000a<p>A great source of BCAAs and other amino acids are <a href="http://www.nutmilkshop.com/2017/01/27/drink-cashew-and-almond-milks-for-better-workouts/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">cashew and almond milks</a>. A glass of either nut milk gives you over 5 grams of BCAAs and even more in other amino acids.</p>\u000a<h2>2. Enjoy Kimchi, Chongkukjang, Doenjang and other Exotic Korean Fermented Dishes and Boost Your Immunity</h2>\u000a<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3750756/">Researchers </a>found that your intestines and the lymphoid tissue surrounding them (collectively known as GALT) are one of your immune system&#8217;s largest defense front lines. They say GALT is your largest immune organ and serves many vital major functions, including the major defender and barrier against oral pathogens coming from your mouth, keeping balance with your good bacteria (teaching the immune system to ignore them), sorting out normal food particles from potentially toxic particles you&#8217;ve ingested, and acting as a &#8220;school&#8221; for baby T and B immune cells where they mature by exposing them to various antigens and then leave to defend other parts of your body.</p>\u000a<p>But, if you don&#8217;t have enough protein, researchers found that your immune system becomes suppressed. They also say that protein malnutrition is the top cause for immune deficiency worldwide. They play a huge role in your GALT&#8217;s immune capacities. The amino acid glutamine maintains the integrity of your gut barrier. In fact, supplementation with glutamine has been found to help with <i>E. coli</i> infections. It also boosts the proliferation and gene expression of various immune cells in your gut.</p>\u000a<p>The amino acid glutamate is used primarily by your intestinal epithelial cells for energy and it&#8217;s also vital for the function of immune cells in your GALT. Researchers found that your B cells and mononuclear cells make more antibodies when you supplement with glutamate. They also found that glutamate regulates your T cells in your gut.</p>\u000a<p>Supplementing with the amino acid arginine has been found to lower bad bacteria counts in your gut, increase the height of your intestine&#8217;s villi (which are responsible for nutrient absorption), and lower intestinal damage by bad bacteria infection (like <i>E.coli</i>).</p>\u000a<p>The amino acids threonine, methionine, and cysteine have also been found to boost your immune cell count, increase your villi height, and strengthen your gut&#8217;s integrity.</p>\u000a<p>According to <a href="http://www.skorea.net/the-most-delicious-fermented-dishes-of-s-korea/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">S. Korea</a>, most Korean fermented foods are soy-based. <a href="http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/legumes-and-legume-products/4376/2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Soybeans</a> are high in protein, with 1.24 grams of threonine, 0.39 grams of methionine, and 2.22 grams of arginine in one cup. But during the fermentation process, the amino acids convert into free form, which make them more bioavailable since free form amino acids bypass the liver and enter your bloodstream ready for use (non-free amino acids must be digested by your gut and broken down into free amino acids by your liver&#8217;s and pancreas&#8217;s enzymes before capable of being used).</p>\u000a<p>S. Korea says that chongkukjang and doenjang are two well-fermented soy dishes. They&#8217;re made by boiling soybeans followed by fermentation ceremonies that last from days to months! The result are different aged soybean pastes with more bioavailable amino acids delivered in an exotic delicacy that you can use with salad dressing, in soup broths, or as a dip for chips.</p>\u000a<p>Besides making amino acids more available, S. Korea says their extensive fermentation processes enrich them with healthy scores of probiotics that boost your immunity, relieve allergies, and heal your gut. Doenjang even has anti-obesity properties &#8211; <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24456362">researchers </a>found that people who eat it daily lose fat in prone areas without additional exercise or dieting. Doenjang has also been found to suppress your appetite and delay aging by protecting your DNA from harmful free radicals.</p>\u000a<p>You can also try ganjang and gochujang, which are two other Korean soybean fermented dishes that researchers found have holistic benefits.</p>\u000a<p>If you prefer the popular kimchi, which is another Korean fermented dish made with various vegetables, it gives you a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5039233/">fair amount of amino acids too</a>. Its main ingredient is Chinese cabbage, which has significant amounts of the two GALT-essential amino acids threonine and arginine, along with other healthy amino acids and nutrients.</p>\u000a<h2>3. Snack on Bulgarian Yogurt to Help Prevent and Alleviate Sleep Apnea</h2>\u000a<p><a href="http://www.hchs.edu/literature/BCAA.pdf">Huntington College of Health Sciences</a> says that taking BCAAs helps prevent and lessen sleep apnea. The increase in supply of amino acids regulates your brain&#8217;s neurotransmitter levels, which researchers found gives your brain better control of your respiratory function while you sleep.</p>\u000a<p>Yogurt is surprisingly rich in amino acids! <a href="https://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/dairy-and-egg-products/106/2">One serving</a> has 1.41 grams of leucine, 0.77 grams of isoleucine, and 1.16 grams of valine, which are all BCAAs. It also has significant amounts of threonine, arginine, cysteine, and methionine too.</p>\u000a<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9841662">Researchers</a> found that the amino acids in yogurt are more bioavailable because its probiotic bacteria convert 70 percent into free form amino acids.</p>\u000a<p>Try <a href="http://www.europeanhomeremedies.com/2016/06/25/bulgarian-yogurt/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bulgarian yogurt</a>, which has been traditionally enjoyed by the Balkan people for centuries.

VWYOMING\u2014A recent study from the Wyoming Institute of Technology (WIT) has shown that watching reality TV is worse for your brain function than chronic methamphetamine abuse.\u000a\u000aPrevious studies have shown that long term meth use greatly reduces the binding of dopamine\u2014a chemical involved in pleasure, motivation, and motor function\u2014to its transporters, causing a myriad of serious effects and an increased dependence on the drug. However, Dr. Joan Collins of the Wyoming Institute of Technology has recently found a link between methamphetamine-like effects and watching reality TV shows such as \u201cThe Real Housewives,\u201d and \u201cKeeping Up With the Kardashians.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI noticed that people who watched one or two episodes of reality TV would become increasingly hooked, and began to binge watch it,\u201d she commented. \u201cThis reminded me of how drug users can become addicted to a drug, so I decided to investigate.\u201d\u000a\u000aCollins conducted her study by scanning the brains of 100 methamphetamine (meth) abusers and 100 people who regularly watch reality TV. She then compared the resulting MRI scans to compare the effects of both substances on the brain.\u000a\u000aAside from the similar effects on dopamine, Dr. Collins and her team found that reality TV also produces mood effects and memory loss in a similar vein as meth. Participants in the study noted that they were often angry while watching reality TV\u2014though Collins notes that it\u2019s unclear whether this anger was directed at what they were watching, or their own lives for failing to live up to televised expectations\u2014and that they were unable to remember what they were doing before they sat down to watch TV, and what they had planned to do after they were done.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt was like I was in a daze,\u201d study participant Sierra Brown commented. \u201cI\u2019d put on The Bachelor and I\u2019d immediately forget any plans I had. All that mattered was sitting down and watching another episode.\u201d\u000a\u000aThis study also suggests that reality TV may potentially be more addictive than methamphetamines. One of the participants claimed that watching reality TV cured her of her meth addiction.\u000a\u000a\u201cOnce I started watching reality TV I was hooked, man,\u201d she said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t get off the couch to do anything. I was too busy watching reruns of Jersey Shore to even do meth. So I quit. But it was like I swapped one addiction for another. I wasn\u2019t sleeping, I was barely eating. One time, I had Chinese takeout delivered to my house for three days because I wouldn\u2019t get off the couch.\u201d\u000a\u000aAfter the breakthrough she made with this study, Dr. Collins will devote future research to help rehabilitate Americans who have been affected by reality TV.\u000a\u000a(Image Source: Wiki)

VTRUMP TOWER, N.Y. \u2014 To offset skyrocketing campaign costs, Donald Trump reportedly asked the Commission for Presidential Debates to broadcast the upcoming face-offs against Hillary Clinton as pay-per-view (PPV) events. The first debate will be held at Hofstra University in Hempstead, NY, on Sept. 26.\u000a\u000aUsually associated with sporting events, PPV allows cable subscribers to view special events on a one-time-only basis, after paying a fee.\u000a\u000aAlthough Trump stressed that his proposal would benefit both parties and is not a moneymaking scheme, critics were quick to denounce the request.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is another one of Donald Trump\u2019s get rich quick tactics,\u201d said Hillary Clinton. \u201cThe fact is, Donald Trump doesn\u2019t want to cough up the money it takes to pay for a campaign.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly expensive to run a presidential campaign,\u201d said Trump. \u201cUnbelievably expensive to keep this operation going. A lot of money. And by the way, if I were Crooked Hillary, I wouldn\u2019t talk about coughing up anything. Especially with he state of her health.\u201d\u000a\u000aAs of September, Trump raised $35,347,440 from outside groups, and $125,220,991 from his campaign committee. Hillary Clinton raised $120,108,804 from outside sources, and $315,353,001 from her campaign committee.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is fundamentally unfair,\u201d said Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson, excluded from the first debate because of low poll numbers. The debate commission sets the minimum number for participation at 15%. Johnson polls at 9% nationally.\u000a\u000a\u201cPaying to hear candidates is ludicrous,\u201d said Johnson. \u201cHow much more money does Donald Trump need? When I first read about this, I was convinced it came from a satire website!\u201d\u000a\u000a24 million viewers tuned into the first Republican presidential debate, largely due to Trump\u2019s participation. If Trump\u2019s request is granted, the event could shatter previous viewership and revenue records.\u000a\u000aTo date, the highest grossing pay television event is the 2015 Pacquiao vs. Mayweather boxing match. Over 4.6 million cable subscribers spent more than $400 million. $200 million went to Floyd Mayweather, and Manny Pacquiao\u2019s take was $100 million.

VDue to the increase of \u2018creepy clown threats\u2019 across the United States over the past few weeks, the United States Government has allegedly begun meetings regarding dealing with this threat on a national level. While local authorities have been left to deal with incidents like the ones in Puyallup, Washington, Sacramento, California, and Dallas, Texas \u2013 our sources claim that the Federal government is \u201cprepared to give aid to combat this threat\u201d.\u000a\u000aOver two years ago, this reporter covered the invasion of the small town of Wasco, California by a \u2018creepy clown\u2019. In the Wasco case, many inside the government believed it was a \u201cterror cell doing a dry run\u201d to stress test the response of local law enforcement. While the current outbreak of \u2018creepy clown threats\u2019 could largely be the cause of it being \u201cHalloween season\u201d and teenagers with too much time on their hands \u2013 many are not taking these threats lying down.\u000a\u000aI spoke directly to one of my most trusted sources in Washington, D.C., as several of these threats have hit very close to where I\u2019m based out of. My source reported back to me that these \u2018creepy clown threats\u2019 are being treated as a legitimate threat to America\u2019s safety. The source alleges that \u201cthe FBI is involved at this point. The President has also been briefed and is being kept current on these threats. The U.S. Government is taking this threat to the nation very seriously.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cCathy, you were really on to something with your reporting on the Wasco sightings a few years back. Even though the culprits were never truly outed, there was way more to that than was reported by everyone except National Report,\u201d my source told me. \u201cFrom what I\u2019ve seen and I\u2019ve been told by those \u2018in the know\u2019, these threats, by in large, are not just some drunken teenagers screwing around on Instagram. This is \u2018real deal terrorism\u2019 and could quickly escalate into something that rural sheriff\u2019s departments are not equipped to handle.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhen I pressed my source for more information, they just warned me to \u201cnot go out at night\u201d and \u201cavoid doing anything in the evening during the Halloween weekend\u201d. They alleged this was based on \u201cchatter\u201d they\u2019ve been privy to over the last few days. My source also suggested to avoid \u201cany and all locations that any of the \u2018creepy clown threat\u2019 social media accounts list\u201d. So, using their warning, if your teen\u2019s high school has been listed as a place a \u2018creepy clown\u2019 is going to hit up, it might be best for them to \u201ccome down with a cold\u201d until this all blows over.\u000a\u000aMy source stopped short of saying the National Guard has been mobilized to contain the \u2018creepy clown threats\u2019, but they did suggest an official statement from President Barack Obama was likely forthcoming on this issue. The source did say they were \u201cconcerned with Obama\u2019s potential response to this\u201d and suggesting that \u2018martial law\u2019 is a term that has been thrown around in \u201ctop level meetings\u201d for cities that are overrun with the clowns.\u000a\u000a(Image Source: Wiki)

VTRUMP TOWER, N.Y. \u2014 To offset skyrocketing campaign costs, Donald Trump reportedly asked the Commission for Presidential Debates to broadcast the upcoming face-offs against Hillary Clinton as pay-per-view (PPV) events. The first debate will be held at Hofstra University in Hempstead, NY, on Sept. 26.\u000a\u000aUsually associated with sporting events, PPV allows cable subscribers to view special events on a one-time-only basis, after paying a fee.\u000a\u000aAlthough Trump stressed that his proposal would benefit both parties and is not a moneymaking scheme, critics were quick to denounce the request.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is another one of Donald Trump\u2019s get rich quick tactics,\u201d said Hillary Clinton. \u201cThe fact is, Donald Trump doesn\u2019t want to cough up the money it takes to pay for a campaign.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly expensive to run a presidential campaign,\u201d said Trump. \u201cUnbelievably expensive to keep this operation going. A lot of money. And by the way, if I were Crooked Hillary, I wouldn\u2019t talk about coughing up anything. Especially with he state of her health.\u201d\u000a\u000aAs of September, Trump raised $35,347,440 from outside groups, and $125,220,991 from his campaign committee. Hillary Clinton raised $120,108,804 from outside sources, and $315,353,001 from her campaign committee.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is fundamentally unfair,\u201d said Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson, excluded from the first debate because of low poll numbers. The debate commission sets the minimum number for participation at 15%. Johnson polls at 9% nationally.\u000a\u000a\u201cPaying to hear candidates is ludicrous,\u201d said Johnson. \u201cHow much more money does Donald Trump need? When I first read about this, I was convinced it came from a satire website!\u201d\u000a\u000a24 million viewers tuned into the first Republican presidential debate, largely due to Trump\u2019s participation. If Trump\u2019s request is granted, the event could shatter previous viewership and revenue records.\u000a\u000aTo date, the highest grossing pay television event is the 2015 Pacquiao vs. Mayweather boxing match. Over 4.6 million cable subscribers spent more than $400 million. $200 million went to Floyd Mayweather, and Manny Pacquiao\u2019s take was $100 million.

VFONDUE LAKE, WISCONSIN \u2014 A local story out of the Cheese State has murmurs of the so-called \u201cWar on Christmas\u201d echoing throughout the country once again. As reported by local TV-station WWISC, a man named Bill Ricci \u2014 self-described \u201cChristian first conservative\u201d \u2014 made the news when he refused to give a homeless man a quarter because he would have had to put into the red Starbucks holiday cup that the homeless man was holding. Ricci hosts a weekly right-wing podcast and told his listeners about the confrontation.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019m walking into the grocery store, and out in the parking lot is a homeless,\u201d Ricci told his audience, \u201cand he asks me if I have any change. Now, normally this is when I\u2019d give him my tried and true homeless guy lecture I\u2019ve developed about how if I give him a quarter today he\u2019d spend it on booze or drugs or whatever a homeless would spend it on. But I happened to be in a mega-hurry that day, so I reached into my pocket and fished out a quarter.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut, Ricci says, as he was about to give the homeless man the quarter, he noticed that the homeless man was holding a red cup from Starbucks. Ricci says he quickly put the quarter back in his pocket. He advised the homeless man that he cannot, \u201cas a good Christian\u201d give the man money when \u201cit would end up in Satan\u2019s drinking vessel.\u201d Ricci says he firmly believes Starbucks is a key perpetrator in the War on Christmas, and he refuses to buy coffee there, as well as make any charitable gifts to homeless people holding said red cups.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhy can\u2019t they just give we Christians one more cultural wink and a nod,\u201d Ricci asked, \u201cwhy can\u2019t their cups have a big ol\u2019 nativity scene on them with big bold letters that say, \u2018MERRY CHRISTMAS FROM JESUS CHRIST AND STARBUCKS!\u2019 In my day, companies would have fallen all over themselves to placate my religious beliefs. That\u2019s changed, and I don\u2019t like change.\u201d\u000a\u000aRicci told his audience that he explained his hesitance to show him a charitable spirit as best he could.\u000a\u000a\u201cI told him,\u201d Mr. Ricci said, \u201cthat if he wants Christian charity from me, he has to give me a Christian vessel to put it in. You know, like when Jesus says in the Bible that blessed are those who make the least fortunate jump through ideological hoops before helping them.\u201d\u000a\u000aAs he closed out the segment, Mr. Ricci explained why he\u2019s glad that President-elect Donald Trump won the election, and how it plays into this interaction with \u201cthe homeless.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThe homeless I talked to,\u201d Ricci said, \u201cwould never even have the gumption to ask me, a taxpayer for help once Trump\u2019s been office long enough. Just like when Ronald Reagan was president, or when either of the brilliant, terrific Bushes were in office, Trump will end homelessness, make our economy grow at 12.8% per quarter, and help us culturally shame poor people into leaving us normals alone.

The series will update the classic 60\u2019s sitcom Mr. Ed, which ran from 1958\u20131966. Parker spoke about the new show at a well-heeled fundraiser for Hillary Clinton.\u000a\u000a\u201cBack in the 60\u2019s,\u201d said Parker, \u201cmuch like today, when there was a great deal of division and social unrest in the country, television programs like Mr. Ed, Bewitched, and I Dream of Jeannie provided an escape. We hope that Mrs. Ed will provide entertainment and commentary on the times we live in today. Mrs. Ed will have a lot to say about today\u2019s political landscape.\u201d\u000a\u000aParker explained that the premise of a talking horse is no more \u201cabsurd\u201d than the idea of Donald Trump as a major party candidate.\u000a\u000aThe original show featured \u201cEd,\u201d a talking Palomino owned by \u201cWilbur Post,\u201d an architect. This time around, the horse is female, and \u201cEd\u201d is short for \u201cEdina.\u201d\u000a\u000aParker will serve as executive producer, and will reportedly provide the voice for the talking horse.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere were rumors that I would actually play the horse,\u201d said Parker, \u201cbut that was someone\u2019s idea of a joke. It all started because of one line I had in Ed Wood. Now that we\u2019re coming down the stretch, I\u2019m happy to wear the executive producer hat, and voice the character this time.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWilbur\u201d has also been re-cast as a female character named \u201cWilma,\u201d who also works as an architect. In the original series, \u201cWilbur\u201d was married to \u201cCarol,\u201d a stay-at home wife. This time around, Wilma is a single mother who purchases Ed \u2014short for Edina\u2014 for her 12-year-old daughter.\u000a\u000aBoth Parker and her husband, actor Matthew Broderick, are high profile, vocal supporters of Hillary Clinton. The couple did not comment on the recently reopened FBI investigation into Clinton\u2019s ongoing email scandal, or her diminishing lead in the polls.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe\u2019re not here to talk politics,\u201d said Broderick. \u201cWe\u2019re here to enjoy a fantastic fundraiser for the next president of the United States!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWe\u2019ll also make sure that all animals will be treated humanely,\u201d added Parker.

VReality TV Worse for Your Health than Heroin, Study Finds

VWYOMING\u2014A recent study from the Wyoming Institute of Technology (WIT) has shown that watching reality TV is worse for your brain function than chronic methamphetamine abuse.\u000a\u000aPrevious studies have shown that long term meth use greatly reduces the binding of dopamine\u2014a chemical involved in pleasure, motivation, and motor function\u2014to its transporters, causing a myriad of serious effects and an increased dependence on the drug.

The report comes from a White House insider, who speaking anonymously, has led this reporter to the possibility that the \u201cBernie Sanders bird\u201d was really just an errant surveillance drone spying on the candidate for Hillary Clinton.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think it\u2019s safe to assume that the President (Obama) and his administration are, not so publicly, endorsing Hillary Clinton for the upcoming election,\u201d said the Washington insider. \u201cI can neither confirm, nor deny, that the President may or may not have specialized UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) that may or may not have been tasked to follow specific candidates that are running against Hillary Clinton.\u201d While the insider used typical Washington doublespeak to not exactly commit to the bird being a man-made creation, someone in the audience at the rally also agreed that things seemed suspicious.\u000a\u000a\u201cI actually followed the bird and heard unnatural sounds coming from it,\u201d claims Marco Roberson, an Engineering major at Portland State University. \u201cI heard sounds coming from the \u2018bird\u2019 that were clearly mechanical in nature.

VNEW YORK, N.Y. \u2014 Sarah Jessica Parker, best known as Sex in The City\u2018s \u201cCarrie Bradshaw,\u201d will return to the small screen this spring, show-running a new, multi-camera sitcom for CBS, called Mrs. Ed. The series will update the classic 60\u2019s sitcom Mr. Ed, which ran from 1958\u20131966. Parker spoke about the new show at a well-heeled fundraiser for Hillary Clinton.\u000a\u000a\u201cBack in the 60\u2019s,\u201d said Parker, \u201cmuch like today, when there was a great deal of division and social unrest in the country, television programs like Mr. Ed, Bewitched, and I Dream of Jeannie provided an escape. We hope that Mrs. Ed will provide entertainment and commentary on the times we live in today. Mrs. Ed will have a lot to say about today\u2019s political landscape.\u201d\u000a\u000aParker explained that the premise of a talking horse is no more \u201cabsurd\u201d than the idea of Donald Trump as a major party candidate.\u000a\u000aThe original show featured \u201cEd,\u201d a talking Palomino owned by \u201cWilbur Post,\u201d an architect. This time around, the horse is female, and \u201cEd\u201d is short for \u201cEdina.\u201d\u000a\u000aParker will serve as executive producer, and will reportedly provide the voice for the talking horse.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere were rumors that I would actually play the horse,\u201d said Parker, \u201cbut that was someone\u2019s idea of a joke. It all started because of one line I had in Ed Wood. Now that we\u2019re coming down the stretch, I\u2019m happy to wear the executive producer hat, and voice the character this time.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWilbur\u201d has also been re-cast as a female character named \u201cWilma,\u201d who also works as an architect. In the original series, \u201cWilbur\u201d was married to \u201cCarol,\u201d a stay-at home wife. This time around, Wilma is a single mother who purchases Ed \u2014short for Edina\u2014 for her 12-year-old daughter.\u000a\u000aBoth Parker and her husband, actor Matthew Broderick, are high profile, vocal supporters of Hillary Clinton. The couple did not comment on the recently reopened FBI investigation into Clinton\u2019s ongoing email scandal, or her diminishing lead in the polls.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe\u2019re not here to talk politics,\u201d said Broderick. \u201cWe\u2019re here to enjoy a fantastic fundraiser for the next president of the United States!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWe\u2019ll also make sure that all animals will be treated humanely,\u201d added Parker.

Parker spoke about the new show at a well-heeled <strong><a href="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/06/21/09/358071B500000578-3651939-image-m-10_1466496488307.jpg">fundraiser</a></strong> for Hillary Clinton.</p>\u000a<p>&#8220;Back in the 60&#8217;s,&#8221; said Parker, &#8220;much like today, when there was a great deal of division and social unrest in the country, television programs like Mr. Ed, <strong><a href="http://seriepix.net/images/series/banner/bewitched-1401453055.jpg">Bewitched</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/a0/84/4d/a0844dd522aa6c940227ee6b00b0c39c.jpg">I Dream of Jeannie</a></strong> provided an escape. We hope that Mrs. Ed will provide entertainment and commentary on the times we live in today. Mrs. Ed will have a lot to say about today&#8217;s political landscape.&#8221;</p>\u000a<p>Parker explained that the premise of a talking horse is no more &#8220;absurd&#8221; than the idea of Donald Trump as a major party candidate.</p>\u000a<p>The original show featured &#8220;Ed,&#8221; a talking Palomino owned by &#8220;Wilbur Post,&#8221; an architect. This time around, the horse is female, and &#8220;Ed&#8221; is short for &#8220;Edina.&#8221;</p>\u000a<p>Parker will serve as executive producer, and will reportedly provide the voice for the talking horse.</p>\u000a<p>&#8220;There were rumors that I would actually play the horse,&#8221; said Parker, &#8220;but that was someone&#8217;s idea of a joke. It all started because of one line I had in <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDV-UkF3D_Q">Ed Wood</a></strong>. Now that we&#8217;re coming down the stretch, I&#8217;m happy to wear the executive producer hat, and voice the character this time.&#8221;</p>\u000a<p>&#8220;Wilbur&#8221; has also been re-cast as a female character named &#8220;Wilma,&#8221; who also works as an architect. In the original series, &#8220;Wilbur&#8221; was married to &#8220;<a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/a8/41/fe/a841fed9668756023f143b5679f376eb.jpg"><strong>Carol</strong></a>,&#8221; a stay-at home wife. This time around, Wilma is a single mother who purchases Ed &#8212;short for Edina&#8212; for her 12-year-old daughter.</p>\u000a<p>Both Parker and her husband, actor Matthew Broderick, are high profile, vocal supporters of Hillary Clinton. The couple did not comment on the recently reopened FBI investigation into Clinton&#8217;s ongoing email scandal, or her diminishing lead in the polls.</p>\u000a<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not here to talk politics,&#8221; said Broderick. &#8220;We&#8217;re here to enjoy a fantastic fundraiser for the next president of the United States!&#8221;</p>\u000a<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll also make sure that all animals will be treated humanely,&#8221; added Parker.</p>\u000a							&#13;\u000a				 \u000a     \u000a \u000a\u000a \u000a \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a<p id="rcjsload_4a0f4b"></p>\u000a\u000a \u000a\u000a<p id="taboola-below-article"></p>\u000a			&#13;\u000a			</div>

VIn 2013, attendees of Cochella were blown away when a holographic image of Tupac Shakur walked onto the stage and began performing his hit song, Hail Mary. Since then, record execs have been mulling over which deceased artist they should resurrect next and it appears they\u2019ve finally made their decision; The legendary grunge rocker, Kurt Cobain.\u000a\u000aYes, it has been confirmed that Kurt Cobain will once again take the stage alongside original Nirvana members, Dave Grohl, and, Krist Novoselic, for what is sure to be the biggest concert event of 2014.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aKurt Cobain is known for being one of the founding members of the 90\u2019s grunge movement. Born in Aberdeen, Washington, he started the band which would go onto become Nirvana in 1987. The late songwriter passed away in 1994 due to a widely publicized and controversial suicide.\u000a\u000aNow, through the magic of holograph technology, Cobain will once again bond with his fans through the medium of live performance. Truly, the only foreseeable downside are incredibly expensive ticket prices, with the cheapest seats going for several hundred dollars.\u000a\u000aDave Grohl has since went on to form his own successful rock group, Foo Fighters, had the following to say about the upcoming tour. \u201cWe\u2019re doing this for the fans, pure and simple. It\u2019s been twenty years since the original Nirvana lineup has played together. It\u2019s going to be an honor to once again share the stage with Cobain. Lots of fond memories. I can\u2019t wait.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe official show dates have yet to be announced but sources indicate that the tour should kick off in the late summer of 2014.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a

Since then, record execs have been mulling over which deceased artist they should resurrect next and it appears they&#8217;ve finally made their decision; The legendary grunge rocker, Kurt Cobain.</p>\u000a<p>Yes, it has been confirmed that Kurt Cobain will once again take the stage alongside original Nirvana members, Dave Grohl, and, Krist Novoselic, for what is sure to be the biggest concert event of 2014.</p>\u000a<p><br>\u000a<br>\u000a<br>\u000a</p>\u000a<p>Kurt Cobain is known for being one of the founding members of the 90&#8217;s grunge movement. Born in Aberdeen, Washington, he started the band which would go onto become Nirvana in 1987. The late songwriter passed away in 1994 due to a widely publicized and controversial suicide.</p>\u000a<p>Now, through the magic of holograph technology, Cobain will once again bond with his fans through the medium of live performance. Truly, the only foreseeable downside are incredibly expensive ticket prices, with the cheapest seats going for several hundred dollars.</p>\u000a<p>Dave Grohl has since went on to form his own successful rock group, Foo Fighters, had the following to say about the upcoming tour. &#8220;We&#8217;re doing this for the fans, pure and simple. It&#8217;s been twenty years since the original Nirvana lineup has played together. It&#8217;s going to be an honor to once again share the stage with Cobain. Lots of fond memories. I can&#8217;t wait.&#8221;</p>\u000a<p>The official show dates have yet to be announced but sources indicate that the tour should kick off in the late summer of 2014.</p>\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a<p><br>\u000a<br>\u000a<br>\u000a</p>\u000a\u000a\u000a<p> \u000a</p>\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a<p> \u000a</p>\u000a\u000a\u000a<p><br>\u000a<br>\u000a<br>\u000a</p>\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a							&#13;\u000a				 \u000a     \u000a \u000a\u000a \u000a \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a<p id="rcjsload_4a0f4b"></p>\u000a\u000a \u000a\u000a<p id="taboola-below-article"></p>\u000a			&#13;\u000a			</div>

VTrump Administration Vetted Hollywood Actors For Cabinet Positions, Sources Report\u000a\u000aHollywood actors Chuck Norris and Scott Baio were each vetted for cabinet positions within the incoming Trump administration, but both of them declined the offers, according to sources close to Donald Trump and within the Trump transition team.\u000a\u000a//\u000a\u000aReports from within the Trump transition team allege that Donald Trump himself had drawn up a short-list of his ideal candidates for various cabinet positions, and both Norris and Baio were amongst the names he floated for those roles. The further into the transition proceedings they got, the more adamant Trump became that both of them should be offered roles.\u000a\u000aChuck Norris was one of the first names Trump suggested for his administration, shortlisting the 76-year old actor for the role of Homeland Security Director. He also considered Norris for a number of roles involving \u201ckeeping America safe,\u201d including FBI Director, CIA Director, and even Secretary of Defense.\u000a\u000a\u201cNobody is going to keep America safer than me, okay? But if that was even possible, it would be Chuck Norris,\u201d Trump told his transition team\u2019s senior advisors in late November. \u201cHe\u2019s worked in law enforcement as a Texas Ranger. He\u2019s very classy, very skilled, okay? He\u2019s so good. The best, really. Chuck Norris is the best. I want him on my team.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut Norris turned down those offers, graciously thanking Trump for his consideration. That, insiders claim, is when Trump rolled out the \u201cbig guns,\u201d offering Chuck Norris one last job: filling Antonin Scalia\u2019s seat on the United States Supreme Court. But reports show that Norris politely turned down that position as well, seemingly not wanting to have any role in the Trump administration whatsoever.\u000a\u000aScott Baio As Labor Secretary?\u000a\u000aScott Baio was reportedly more receptive to the idea of working with the Trump Administration, excitedly accepting Trump\u2019s offer for the role of Labor Secretary, a job transition team staffers were shocked to learn had been offered to Baio without Trump having consulted anyone.\u000a\u000a//\u000a\u000a\u201cHe never asked anyone. he just sort of called [Scott Baio] up on the phone and said \u2018hey, you want this job?'\u201d Says one senior-level advisor on the Trump transition team. \u201cWe had to do all of our vetting on him after he had already accepted the job. And even after we found stuff, [Trump] refused to turn Scott away. We had to approach him directly and say \u2018look, this stuff from the 1990\u2019s and 2000\u2019s is going to get out in the media. It\u2019s going to ruin you. If you take this job, we can\u2019t stop it.\u2019 It took all that to prevent Scott Baio from becoming Labor Secretary.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhy was Trump so adamant about giving Scott Baio the Labor Secretary job? \u201cBecause [Baio] has real-world experience that none of us has, not even me,\u201d Trump told transition staffers. \u201cDo you know all the jobs he\u2019s had since the 1990\u2019s? Waiting tables, bussing tables, pumping gas, landscaping, customer service in a call center, working the register at a Burlington Coat Factory, he\u2019s had all of these jobs. He knows jobs better than anybody. And right now he owns a small business, too, driving an Uber, so he understands what business owners have to go through. Scott Baio knows jobs. He knows labor. He\u2019s the only man I want for the job.\u201d\u000a\u000a//\u000a\u000aWe attempted to reach out to both Chuck Norris and Scott Baio for comments. Mr. Norris politely denied our request for an interview. Scott Baio had to also decline due to scheduling conflicts with his double-shift between driving his Uber and his part-time job at a Cinnabon in the Greater Los Angeles area.

VFONDUE LAKE, WISCONSIN \u2014 A local story out of the Cheese State has murmurs of the so-called \u201cWar on Christmas\u201d echoing throughout the country once again. As reported by local TV-station WWISC, a man named Bill Ricci \u2014 self-described \u201cChristian first conservative\u201d \u2014 made the news when he refused to give a homeless man a quarter because he would have had to put into the red Starbucks holiday cup that the homeless man was holding. Ricci hosts a weekly right-wing podcast and told his listeners about the confrontation.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019m walking into the grocery store, and out in the parking lot is a homeless,\u201d Ricci told his audience, \u201cand he asks me if I have any change. Now, normally this is when I\u2019d give him my tried and true homeless guy lecture I\u2019ve developed about how if I give him a quarter today he\u2019d spend it on booze or drugs or whatever a homeless would spend it on. But I happened to be in a mega-hurry that day, so I reached into my pocket and fished out a quarter.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut, Ricci says, as he was about to give the homeless man the quarter, he noticed that the homeless man was holding a red cup from Starbucks. Ricci says he quickly put the quarter back in his pocket. He advised the homeless man that he cannot, \u201cas a good Christian\u201d give the man money when \u201cit would end up in Satan\u2019s drinking vessel.\u201d Ricci says he firmly believes Starbucks is a key perpetrator in the War on Christmas, and he refuses to buy coffee there, as well as make any charitable gifts to homeless people holding said red cups.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhy can\u2019t they just give we Christians one more cultural wink and a nod,\u201d Ricci asked, \u201cwhy can\u2019t their cups have a big ol\u2019 nativity scene on them with big bold letters that say, \u2018MERRY CHRISTMAS FROM JESUS CHRIST AND STARBUCKS!\u2019 In my day, companies would have fallen all over themselves to placate my religious beliefs. That\u2019s changed, and I don\u2019t like change.\u201d\u000a\u000aRicci told his audience that he explained his hesitance to show him a charitable spirit as best he could.\u000a\u000a\u201cI told him,\u201d Mr. Ricci said, \u201cthat if he wants Christian charity from me, he has to give me a Christian vessel to put it in. You know, like when Jesus says in the Bible that blessed are those who make the least fortunate jump through ideological hoops before helping them.\u201d\u000a\u000aAs he closed out the segment, Mr. Ricci explained why he\u2019s glad that President-elect Donald Trump won the election, and how it plays into this interaction with \u201cthe homeless.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThe homeless I talked to,\u201d Ricci said, \u201cwould never even have the gumption to ask me, a taxpayer for help once Trump\u2019s been office long enough. Just like when Ronald Reagan was president, or when either of the brilliant, terrific Bushes were in office, Trump will end homelessness, make our economy grow at 12.8% per quarter, and help us culturally shame poor people into leaving us normals alone. Well, one of those things is true and going to happen at least.\u201d\u000a\u000aRepublished from The Political Garbage Chute.\u000a\u000aFollow James on Twitter @JamboSchlarmbo.

V22-year-old Tommy Gibbs lays strapped to a hospital gurney at the Johnson-Hemingway Neurological Research institute. Trapped within a catatonic state, he stares vacantly towards the ceiling. His mother, Harriet Gibbs, sits nearby, sobbing quietly into her hands. Her voice shakes as she begins to speak, recalling a time not long ago when her son still had his entire life ahead of him. Before he was cruelly robbed of such a promising future.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u201cPeople think marijuana is this harmless substance, and perhaps it is, in its unadulterated form. All I know is that dabs are a completely different monster. My son had finished school and was just about to start his internship when he was introduced to dabs. Pretty soon that\u2019s all he cared about. He spent all his time \u201cseshing\u201d, which basically means getting together with a bunch of other addicts to consume large quantities of these concentrates in a sort of opium den setting.\u201d Mrs. Gibbs continued, fighting through the tears, \u201cThey call the product by many names, bho, wax, shatter, budder, oil. All I know is that my son was hooked. Things went downhill quickly for him, and he spent most days just fumbling around in a muddled state. Soon after that I got the call every mother dreads.\u201d\u000a\u000aOn the other end of the line was Tommy\u2019s best friend, Leo Robinson, calling from the emergency room at St Jude Hospital in Greensville Pass. Tommy and a group of friends had spent the greater part of the evening \u201cseshing\u201d. One of these men brought a large amount of some particularly potent concentrate with them, and decided they should see who could take the largest hit. \u201cTommy seemed really into it. He wanted to win\u201d, his friend Leo remembers from the night which forever changed their lives. \u201cWe had done this a bunch of times before so I didn\u2019t think it was a big deal. I wish I could go back in time. If I could do it all over again I would never have used dabs. Never.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aTommy, surrounded by his cheering friends, ended up inhaling over 6 grams of the potent extract in one go. Moments later they were horrified to witness Tommy fall into violent convulsions before passing out. After several failed attempts to revive him, his friends called an ambulance. Once admitted to the hospital, Tommy stopped breathing twice. He had to be resuscitated and was put into a medically induced coma for 14 days. Once he finally gained consciousness, he had lost 75% of his cognitive abilities.\u000a\u000aMrs. Gibbs now takes care of her handicapped son as a full time job. When asked what other parents should know regarding the consumption of \u201cdabs\u201d, she responded with the following, \u201cWhat Tommy and his pals thought was just some harmless fun turned a life shattering event for everyone involved. Our family is absolutely destroyed because of this.. Please inform your children that experimenting with this drug could not only cost them their lives, but it also could put their families into a situation where they need to be cared for 24-7. I never wanted this, and I know Tommy never wanted this. It\u2019s as if your child has died in a way. Please don\u2019t touch this stuff, for the love of god.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a

A Russian liaison working closely with transition leaders said Putin will reprise his 2012 charity event performance of the song.\u000a\u000a\u201cPresident Putin wishes he could attend the festivities in person,\u201d said the liaison, identified as Althea Thoonyev. \u201cLogistics, prior commitments, matters of state, and security concerns necessitate performance via live video.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cGlasnost was the beginning of a new openness throughout Russia,\u201d said Thoonyev. \u201cPresident Putin wishes to further bridge the perceived divide between our two nations using music \u2014 the universal language.\u201d\u000a\u000aTrump opponents say Putin\u2019s appearance is a PR stunt, engineered to deflect attention from unfounded charges that Putin interfered with America\u2019s presidential election.\u000a\u000aKid Rock, Ted Nugent, and country superstar Garth Brooks are reportedly in negotiations to perform. 16-year-old America\u2019s Got Talent singer Jackie Evancho will sing \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnita Bryant, 1958\u2019s Miss Oklahoma, Save Our Children founder, and the Florida Citrus Commission\u2019s former brand ambassador, will reportedly sing \u201cTomorrow Belongs To Me,\u201d the featured anthem from the musical Cabaret.\u000a\u000aDespite the blockbuster lineup, mainstream media outlets still say Trump is having trouble securing top headliners.\u000a\u000aThe latest performer to bow out is \u201cPopera\u201d singer Andrea Bocelli. The Italian classical tenor and recording artist caved in to social media pressure, after many of his fans threatened to boycott future concerts.\u000a\u000a\u201cWith or without Bocelli,\u201d said Thoonyev, \u201cthis glorious event will go down in history as the best inauguration we\u2019ve ever had. We booked the President of Russia! We\u2019ve got the best performers, the most incredibly, unbelievably talented performers. Believe me,\u201d she said.

VRetailers across the United States are reporting a spike in sales of pressure cookers following alleged terrorist bombings in New York City and New Jersey over the weekend. While the New Jersey incident featured \u201cpipe-bomb-style\u201d devices, the New York explosion was caused by a \u201cpressure cooker device\u201d and resulted in twenty-nine injuries. Astute readers will recall that the Boston Marathon bombers used pressure cooker bombs to create terror in 2013. Much like how firearms advocates fear a \u201cgun grab\u201d by Obama after a mass shooting incident, many United States citizens are fearing a similar \u201cgrab\u201d may happen to their cherished cookers.\u000a\u000a\u201cThey\u2019ll get my cooker from my cold dead hands,\u201d said Ruth Webb, 75, of Fort Worth, Texas. \u201cMy grandkids will not be denied my signature slow cooked beans! You know Hillary is going to use these attacks to restrict our freedoms. Trump 2016!\u201d Webb, and other amateur chefs have flooded social media, specifically \u201cBuy, Sale, Trade\u201d groups on Facebook to stockpile as many pressure cookers as possible. Of course, this has led to some unscrupulous sellers to hike prices on their stock to gouge fearful consumers. \u201cI saw a guy trying to sell a \u2018Presto 01264 6 quart\u2019 model on my local Facebook group for $500,\u201d explained Keith Nelson of Buffalo, New York. \u201cIt\u2019s insane. Those usually sell for around $30 online. The sad thing is many people in the group are afraid Obama or Hillary are going to ban these cookers to \u2018crack down on terrorism\u2019. Meanwhile, these scammers are laughing all of the way to the bank.\u201d\u000a\u000aNo retailers would issue a statement to us regarding this alleged run on pressure cookers. However, we sent an intern to the local Wal-Mart and Target this Sunday afternoon, and he reported that there \u201cdidn\u2019t appear to be any in stock\u201d when he checked. He\u2019s also new and we\u2019re not entirely sure he understood what a pressure cooker is.\u000a\u000aEven after the tragic bombings in 2013, the government has not officially suggested they will restrict the production or sale of pressure cookers \u2013 even when considering their potential dual use in improvised explosives. That still does nothing to assuage the fears of Marge Novak, a retired grandmother from Lexington, Kentucky. Novak posted in a Lexington cooking group that she has \u201calready spent her monthly allowance\u201d on pressure cookers and is \u201clooking to buy as many more as possible on credit or layaway\u201d.\u000a\u000a(Image Source: Wiki)

VNEW YORK, NEW YORK \u2014 In a blast of tweets Sunday afternoon, President-Elect Donald Trump raised eyebrows all over the country by seemingly implying that the election he himself won was fraught with voter fraud.\u000a\u000aWithout citing any evidence for his claim, Trump announced on Twitter that he\u2019d have \u201cwon the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally.\u201d Several news outlets have confirmed that to date no evidence has been brought forth that could remotely substantiate Mr. Trump\u2019s assertion. Many are confused why Trump would bring the issue up, considering he actually won, and casting doubt on the legitimacy of the election hurts him as well. Still others pointed out that heretofore Trump supporters have been nonchalant about facts, so perhaps it won\u2019t hurt him at all.\u000a\u000aIn addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 27, 2016\u000a\u000aOn Monday morning, Trump doubled-down on even expanded his claims of illegal immigrant voting, as well as boasting about curing one of mankind\u2019s most deadly viruses.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u201cIn the coming days, at some point,\u201d Trump told reporters outside his Trump Tower home, \u201cI will provide you evidence that around ten billion \u2014 that\u2019s billion with a B people \u2014 illegal immigrants voted for Hillary Clinton, and I will also provide you the antidote to AIDS that I just developed all by myself, literally while just making a ham and cheese on rye sandwich in the kitchen.

No big whoop.\u201d\u000a\u000aAfter claiming that ten billion \u201cillegal aliens\u201d voted for Ms. Clinton in the election, reporters were eager to ask for proof. They pointed out that there are only currently about seven billion people in total on the planet. They also cited surveys that put the estimated total undocumented population in the U.S. at just about eleven million. Trump\u2019s story seemed to ignore both those facts.\u000a\u000a\u201cFacts, you wanna talk about facts in 2016,\u201d Trump laughed out loud, \u201cfacts don\u2019t matter anymore.

They already somehow believed that three million illegals \u2014 who can\u2019t register to vote without state IDs they can\u2019t get without U.S. citizenship \u2014 voted in the election, but that lie just wasn\u2019t big enough. So Herr \u2014 er I mean MISTER \u2014 Bannon told me to make the lie bigger, bolder. So that\u2019s what I did. Bing-bang-boom. Ten billion Mexicans from Mexico voted for Hillary illegally.\u201d\u000a\u000aUndaunted, reporters pressed Trump for evidence that there are even ten billion people living on Earth. Trump told them he had the evidence \u201cright here\u201d and he fished into his pocket, quickly removing it and showing them all his single, extended middle right finger. After getting extremely close to Trump to verify it was his finger and not his penis, the press pool took a hint and moved onto his claim about curing AIDS.\u000a\u000a\u201cI never said that,\u201d Trump said.\u000a\u000a\u201cBut, you just said that,\u201d a reporter shot back.\u000a\u000a\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t.

Yeah, that\u2019s my friend Shut-The,\u201d Trump said.\u000a\u000aThe reporters were tremendously confounded at this point. Venturing out on a professional limb, one plucky member of the media raised her hand.

VWASHINGTON, D.C. \u2014 The days in President Barack Hussein Obama\u2019s (D-Kenya) presidency are dwindling, and aides close to the first black president are saying he\u2019s been thinking long and hard about what he\u2019ll do once he leaves the White House. Some staffers this week told media outlets that one idea Obama has is to continue one of his most ambitious efforts as president but in the private sector.

VWASILLA, Alaska \u2014 A newly discovered essay entitled \u201cMy Most Admired Woman in History,\u201d reportedly written by former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, names cartoon character Wilma Flintstone as \u201cAmerica\u2019s most historical female influence.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe term paper, written in 1981, was anonymously donated to the Wasilla High School library archives for inclusion in a proposed Sarah Palin Center for Special Studies. The hand-written paper lists Sarah Heath of Wasilla High School as author.\u000a\u000a\u201cI picked Wilma Flintstone as my most admired figurine of history,\u201d the essay begins, \u201cbecause of the many historical hardships she faced without modern appliances, gadgets, and short cuts that we have at our fingertips today, thank God.\u201d\u000a\u000aPerhaps the then 17-year-old Sarah Heath was unaware of the swordfish bread knife, pelican washing machine, and wooly mammoth vacuum cleaner that made Wilma\u2019s day so much easier, not to mention the bird broom, porcupine hairbrush, and tortoise lawnmower.\u000a\u000aWilma\u2019s inner strength and versatility amidst Bedrock\u2018s available resources also was outlined:\u000a\u000a\u201cWilma did not let the small town of Bedrock\u2019s limitedness limit her. By doing such a thing, she set a standard for modern women of today. I am sad to say however, that many of us take her years of sacrifice and toil for granite.\u201d\u000a\u000aPalin\u2019s essay also calls Wilma \u201ca pioneering innovator,\u201d far ahead of her prehistoric time:\u000a\u000a\u201cWilma raised a family, worked part-time jobs sometimes, and put up with a loudmouth husband, and she still found the time to maintain her appearance even though she only had one dress and no shoes. She did the best with what she had, even using rocks for a necklace and animal bones for hair curlers.\u201d\u000a\u000aPalin\u2019s essay ends on a cautionary note, reminding 1981\u2019s modern women to be mindful of Wilma\u2019s legacy:\u000a\u000a\u201cDo not let Wilma Flintstone\u2019s example get swept under the rug, or else one day the strives we have made as women will fade away, like a cave painting. We might all be dragged back to our caves by our hair, barefoot and pregnant, cooking our food over a burning pile of history that we all forgot about.\u201d\u000a\u000aCalls to Sarah Palin\u2019s publicist were not returned as of publication time.

Trump in the White House, the Italian people are treading water in their flood-ravaged streets atop gondola boats, venetian blinded to their drowning landscapes, and no one gives a crap. I beg your pardon, Señor Mateo and Barack Obama, safe and secure on dry land over in the Rose Garden, which I am more than certain has adequate, taxpayer-funded drainage facilities, I pause to remind the real Americans across our great nation that Italy was once a fascist country and by association another failed chapter in Obama\u2019s guest book of waterlogged policy mishaps.\u201d\u000a\u000aAlthough Palin did credit Italian citizens for adapting to Mother\u2019s Nature\u2019s challenges, she stopped short of connecting climate change to Venice\u2019s water issues.\u000a\u000a\u201cBy dealing with Nature\u2019s normal, everyday challenges which happen quite regularly, and by making a cottage industry of tourism and fine dining because of it, I extend a global handshake of appreciation across the pond to the Italian people for their adaptability during this challenging cycle for their entrepreneurial spirit which keeps Italy afloat.\u201d\u000a\u000aPalin says becoming Energy Secretary in a Trump administration would be a high water mark in her political career, but says she will accept any appointment that President Donald J.

VTrump Administration Vetted Hollywood Actors For Cabinet Positions, Sources Report\u000a\u000aHollywood actors Chuck Norris and Scott Baio were each vetted for cabinet positions within the incoming Trump administration, but both of them declined the offers, according to sources close to Donald Trump and within the Trump transition team.\u000a\u000a//\u000a\u000aReports from within the Trump transition team allege that Donald Trump himself had drawn up a short-list of his ideal candidates for various cabinet positions, and both Norris and Baio were amongst the names he floated for those roles. The further into the transition proceedings they got, the more adamant Trump became that both of them should be offered roles.\u000a\u000aChuck Norris was one of the first names Trump suggested for his administration, shortlisting the 76-year old actor for the role of Homeland Security Director. He also considered Norris for a number of roles involving \u201ckeeping America safe,\u201d including FBI Director, CIA Director, and even Secretary of Defense.\u000a\u000a\u201cNobody is going to keep America safer than me, okay? But if that was even possible, it would be Chuck Norris,\u201d Trump told his transition team\u2019s senior advisors in late November. \u201cHe\u2019s worked in law enforcement as a Texas Ranger. He\u2019s very classy, very skilled, okay? He\u2019s so good. The best, really. Chuck Norris is the best. I want him on my team.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut Norris turned down those offers, graciously thanking Trump for his consideration. That, insiders claim, is when Trump rolled out the \u201cbig guns,\u201d offering Chuck Norris one last job: filling Antonin Scalia\u2019s seat on the United States Supreme Court. But reports show that Norris politely turned down that position as well, seemingly not wanting to have any role in the Trump administration whatsoever.\u000a\u000aScott Baio As Labor Secretary?\u000a\u000aScott Baio was reportedly more receptive to the idea of working with the Trump Administration, excitedly accepting Trump\u2019s offer for the role of Labor Secretary, a job transition team staffers were shocked to learn had been offered to Baio without Trump having consulted anyone.\u000a\u000a//\u000a\u000a\u201cHe never asked anyone. he just sort of called [Scott Baio] up on the phone and said \u2018hey, you want this job?'\u201d Says one senior-level advisor on the Trump transition team. \u201cWe had to do all of our vetting on him after he had already accepted the job. And even after we found stuff, [Trump] refused to turn Scott away. We had to approach him directly and say \u2018look, this stuff from the 1990\u2019s and 2000\u2019s is going to get out in the media. It\u2019s going to ruin you. If you take this job, we can\u2019t stop it.\u2019 It took all that to prevent Scott Baio from becoming Labor Secretary.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhy was Trump so adamant about giving Scott Baio the Labor Secretary job? \u201cBecause [Baio] has real-world experience that none of us has, not even me,\u201d Trump told transition staffers. \u201cDo you know all the jobs he\u2019s had since the 1990\u2019s? Waiting tables, bussing tables, pumping gas, landscaping, customer service in a call center, working the register at a Burlington Coat Factory, he\u2019s had all of these jobs. He knows jobs better than anybody. And right now he owns a small business, too, driving an Uber, so he understands what business owners have to go through. Scott Baio knows jobs. He knows labor. He\u2019s the only man I want for the job.\u201d\u000a\u000a//\u000a\u000aWe attempted to reach out to both Chuck Norris and Scott Baio for comments. Mr. Norris politely denied our request for an interview. Scott Baio had to also decline due to scheduling conflicts with his double-shift between driving his Uber and his part-time job at a Cinnabon in the Greater Los Angeles area.

VBy Nigel J. Covington III\u000a\u000aEditor-in-Chief\u000a\u000a<National Report> According to legend black men have larger penises than their white contemporaries. But is there any truth to this old myth? It\u2019s a question that has sparked controversy for the last 150 years, from the time of the US Civil War.\u000a\u000aTo honor Black History Month and the achievements of many black Americans who\u2019ve contributed greatly to the advancement of humanity in the sciences, inventions, medicine, technology and much more, the National Report, decided to research this perplexing question to learn what we could about the legend and determine if there\u2019s any meat to support the claim.\u000a\u000aThe origin of this myth can be traced back to a man named Richard Johnson, who used the nickname \u201cDick.\u201d Johnson served honorably in the United States Colored Troops (USCT), from May 1863, through March 1865, when he was mustered out of the army after being wounded in the Battle of Hatcher\u2019s Station.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s said that while Johnson was recovering from a gunshot wound in the hospital he told an amazing story to a group of other black soldiers who like him were also recovering from their own battle wounds. His story had to do with how he escaped the hands of an angry lynch mob and lived to tell about it. Johnson\u2019s account spread throughout the black troops and into the civilian populace. It has since been known as \u201cThe Legend of ol\u2019 Nigger Dick,\u201d as Johnson was known.\u000a\u000aThe Legend of ol\u2019 Nigger Dick\u000a\u000aJohnson claimed as a young man he\u2019d been seized one evening by a half dozen drunken white men who believed him to be the \u201cblack man\u201d responsible for a series of unnatural rapes involving sheep from local farms. The animals were examined by a local \u201cdoctor,\u201d what kind of doctor he was has been lost to history. The doctor said the culprit had to have a small penis which he determined from finding only minor evidence that the sheep had been sexually active recently.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aJohnson stated he\u2019d been taken out of town a short distance and tied to a tree. Standing alone in the dark he could hear the conversation the white men were having while one tied a noose in his rope. He heard one of the white men suggested they check the prisoner\u2019s manhood just to confirm he was the right man.\u000a\u000aThe other men laughed at the suggestion so this man of conscious decided to look for himself proclaiming he\u2019d not take part in lynching an innocent man. Once he\u2019d exposed Johnson\u2019s member it was clear he couldn\u2019t be the perpetrator since he was sporting a fine specimen which, it was noted was considerable in size.\u000a\u000aWith evidence in hand this man of conscience declared Johnson to be innocent. But the scene itself made the matter mute by creating so much hilarity with the drunk lynching party they never observed Johnson being freed by this man of conscience.\u000a\u000aBeing a braver man than I, Johnson said he couldn\u2019t resist the temptation of what came next. Johnson told the men that all black men are much larger than any white man as he swung his manhood in circles as if it were a propeller. Only then did the lynching party realize Johnson was no longer tied to the tree.\u000a\u000aIt was then Johnson claims, he fled to the woods and into darkness. When he stopped he was surprised not to hear the sounds of riders approaching. He listened carefully and could hear faint sounds of the wailing and dejected men of the forlorn lynching party consoling one another apparently distraught over having smaller penises than black men.\u000a\u000aThe Legend of ol\u2019 Nigger Dick, also spread throughout the white populace but was largely dismissed by white men as old Negro folklore. Since that day white Americans have obsessed over hard, thick, hung, huge, throbbing, black, dripping phallus.\u000a\u000aEven today black penis is an old timey favorite that always makes for a rousing discourse around the family dinner table in many homes of white America, as it has from the time of the Civil War.\u000a\u000aOur research of medical documents, case histories and old newspaper accounts since the time of the Civil War failed to turn up any conclusive evidence to support the myth that black men are larger than white men. Therefore this controversy has continued into our present time without any confirmation of who has the biggest dicks. That is until last week.\u000a\u000aOn February 12, 2015, the news broke around the world that an American living in Florida had undergone the first penis reduction surgery in history. The patient was surprisingly a mere white American schoolboy, practically a toddler, whose monster cock settled this controversy once and for all.

Trump has already been raising eyebrows with his cabinet and adviser selections.\u000a\u000aTrump tapped Jeff Sessions as his Attorney General when Sessions was deemed too racist for a federal judgeship back in the 1980\u2019s. He\u2019s asked Steve Bannon, an executive for Breitbart News, which frequently publishes white nationalist and white supremacist news under the banner of the \u201calt-right\u201d movement, to be his Chief Strategist. This week he announced that South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley will be his U.N. ambassador despite having no experience in the State Department, and has reportedly asked Dr. Ben Carson \u2014 a chief rival during the Republican primaries \u2014 to be his Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).\u000a\u000aAt a press conference late Tuesday night, Trump gave some insight into his thinking process in inviting Carson into the role of HUD secretary.\u000a\u000a\u201cWell, I mean, you know, he\u2019s um, one of them, isn\u2019t he,\u201d Trump asked rhetorically.\u000a\u000aReporters asked Trump what he meant by \u201cone of them.\u201d The president-elect first just winked back at the reporters. When they didn\u2019t understand what he meant, he tried touching his nose. Exasperated, Mr. Trump finally answered the question in his trademark way.\u000a\u000a\u201cLook, he\u2019s one of them, you know what I mean,\u201d Trump said, \u201cyou know, his people are into jazz and they have an extra muscle that makes them good sports.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe press pool was still not quite sure what he meant. Trump tried again to explain to him why he was choosing Dr. Carson for his HUD secretaro.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s got the word urban in it, right,\u201d Trump asked, \u201cand when we think of urban we think of people of a certain\u2026type, right? You know they all smoke marihuana cigarrettes and their women are Jezebels, strong sexual appetites, know what I mean?\u201d\u000a\u000aStill, the reporters weren\u2019t quite understanding what Mr. Trump was getting at. He dug in even further.\u000a\u000a\u201cC\u2019mon people, follow me here,\u201d Trump implored them, \u201cthe job has the word urban in it, he\u2019s an urban. You know, an URBAN. Like, his people are incapable of self-care and sink into lunacy under the burden of freedom.\u201d\u000a\u000aLooking puzzled, members of the press pool still couldn\u2019t quite understand what Trump\u2019s meaning was. They pushed for more clarity. Growing ever more flustered, Mr. Trump tried to oblige.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou know, he could be a minstrel,\u201d Trump offered, \u201che\u2019s a good song and dance man, get it? Like, he\u2019s not going to go swimming any time soon, no matter how long ago he ate. Get it now? Huh?\u201d\u000a\u000aAfter fifteen more minutes of trying to get the reporters assembled there to understand him, Trump finally gave up. He dug into his pocket, and got out some black shoe polish. He also got out a large rag and started smearing the polish all over his face, except around his eyes and mouth, there he left his trademark orange skin intact. He began singing.\u000a\u000a\u201cEverything seems lovely when you start to roam,\u201d Trump sang out, continuing, \u201cThe birds are singin\u2019, the day that you stray. But wait until you are further away. Things won\u2019t be so lovely when you\u2019re all alone. Here\u2019s what you\u2019ll keep saying when you\u2019re far from home. Mammy, Mammy. The sun shines east, the sun shines west. I know where the sun shines best.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe media simply grew quiet, their jaws agape.\u000a\u000a\u201cMammy, my little Mammy,\u201d Trump forged on, \u201cMy heartstrings are tangled around Alabammy. I\u2019m comin\u2019, sorry that I made you wait. I\u2019m comin\u2019, hope and trust that I\u2019m not late, oh oh.\u000a\u000aMammy, my little Mammy. I\u2019d walk a million miles for one of your smiles. My Mammy, oh oh.\u201d\u000a\u000aNo one knew what to do, or what to say. So they just kept taking notes as Trump sang on.\u000a\u000a\u201cMammy, my little Mammy,\u201d Mr. Trump bellowed forth, \u201cThe sun shines east, the sun shines west. I know where, I know where the sun shines best. It\u2019s on my Mammy I\u2019m talkin\u2019 about, nobody else\u2019s. My little Mammy. My heartstrings are tangled around Alabammy. Mammy, Mammy, I\u2019m comin\u2019. I, I hope I didn\u2019t make you wait.\u201d\u000a\u000aNow, it seemed that trump was building a crescendo. He was clearly ready to bring it all home. The reporters still just watched in stunned amazement.\u000a\u000a\u201cMammy, Mammy, I\u2019m comin\u2019,\u201d Trump sang, \u201cOh God I, I hope I\u2019m not late. Mammy look at me.

I\u2019d walk a million miles for one of your smiles\u000a\u000aMy Mammy!\u201d\u000a\u000aA report from NPR shows that Trump lost the popular vote by a margin of two million votes to Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton.\u000a\u000aRepublished from The Political Garbage Chute.\u000a\u000aFollow James on Twitter @JamboSchlarmbo.

VVATICAN CITY \u2013 Pope Francis has invited people from all walks of life to the Vatican. Convicted felons, the homeless, even prostitutes have been welcomed into the Kingdom of God by the pontiff. Now, his holiness has sent an invitation to a group of people many thought would never be mentioned by name in the Catholic Church, juggalos.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u2018Juggalos\u2019 (or \u2018juggalettes\u2019 for females) is a name given to militant fans of the hip hop group Insane Clown Posse (ICP). Juggalos have earned gang classification by the FBI and are considered a violent hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC). More recently, juggalos have allegedly become the prime suspects in a string of unsolved animal mutilations throughout the Midwest.\u000a\u000aUpon returning to Rome following his historic 2015 visit to the United States, Pope Francis inquired about the many unwashed youths he saw across America wearing clown makeup and looking hopelessly lost, on drugs, and destitute. \u201cHe was intrigued,\u201d said the pope\u2019s almoner, Bishop Konrad Krajewski, \u201che wanted to know more about these lost souls.\u201d\u000a\u000aDuring his Sunday address, the pope gave a controversial speech that is still reverberating around the world. \u201cI have no right to judge an unwed mother, a troubled youth, a drug addict, or anyone cast aside by society. The Catholic Church will love the poor, care for the orphan, for the sick, the homeless, the beggars, and yes, even the juggalo.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Bishop of Rome then extended an open invitation to all juggalos for an exclusive catered banquet to be held at the Vatican this fall. \u201cMy dear juggalos and juggalettes, the goodness of God has no limits and discriminates against no one. Because of this, the banquet of God\u2019s gifts is universal. I pray you will join me for The Lord\u2019s feast.\u201d\u000a\u000aViolent J, one half of the Insane Clown Posse, was pleasantly surprised by the pope\u2019s invitation, even after learning the invite did not extend to himself or longtime band mate, Shaggy 2 Dope. \u201cHe just radiates this sense of freedom, this sense of openness, this sense of hospitality that is infectious.\u201d Shaggy on the other hand feels a bit slighted by the band\u2019s exclusion. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit f*cked if you ask me.\u201d\u000a\u000aRegardless of Shaggy\u2019s concerns, Violent J says ICP will return the favor by offering the pope an invite to the band\u2019s Gathering of the Juggalos festival. \u201cIt would be f*cking surreal to have the pope at The Gathering, I hope he can make it.\u201d\u000a\u000aOverall reactions to the pope\u2019s juggalo invitation have been mixed. Some Catholics praised Francis for his love and Christian charity, while others have bitterly denounced him as an irresponsible and senile fool who is opening the Vatican doors to violence and vandalism.\u000a\u000aOne critic of Pope Francis, Cardinal Turkson of Ghana, objected to the juggalo banquet. \u201cThey will rob us blind! These so called \u2018guests\u2019 will destroy priceless artifacts and loot every treasure they can find. Hoodlums are not noble and virtuous simply because they live in poverty!\u201d\u000a\u000aNo date has been set for the juggalo banquet as of yet but National Report will be there to cover the event in its entirety.

Offered daily access to sensitive and classified information from around the globe, the U.S.\u2019s incoming leader \u2014 who has no governmental or military experience \u2014 simply declined, declaring he\u2019d rather receive his daily briefings over his favorite social media platform, Twitter.\u000a\u000a\u201cI like Twitter because it trims off all the fat,\u201d Trump told Fox News, \u201cif you can\u2019t get your point across in 140-characters or less, then it can\u2019t be that important anyways.\u201d\u000a\u000aTrump\u2019s team says the president-elect has been focused on the transition and selecting the members of his administration\u2019s Cabinet and say he still has plenty of time to get up to speed on international affairs and security threats before he takes office.\u000a\u000aThe chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Republican Rep. Devin Nunes, who is also a senior member of Trump\u2019s transition team, told the Post that he is not concerned about Trump\u2019s Twitter preference.\u000a\u000a\u201cNational security is Donald Trump\u2019s No. 1 priority and he\u2019s taking it very seriously,\u201d Nunes said. \u201cLook how many leaders he\u2019s met with, how many phone calls he\u2019s taken, positions he\u2019s filled. So what if he uses Twitter\u2026he\u2019s getting the job done.\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. Trump has tweeted almost two dozen times in the last two days, including a barrage of multi-tweet criticisms of the press, a violent tweetstorm about the popular vote and possible fraud, and his latest proposal; to jail or revoke citizenship of people who burn the American flag.

V\u000a\u000aNEW YORK, NEW YORK \u2014 President-Elect Donald J. Trump has already been raising eyebrows with his cabinet and adviser selections.\u000a\u000aTrump tapped Jeff Sessions as his Attorney General when Sessions was deemed too racist for a federal judgeship back in the 1980\u2019s. He\u2019s asked Steve Bannon, an executive for Breitbart News, which frequently publishes white nationalist and white supremacist news under the banner of the \u201calt-right\u201d movement, to be his Chief Strategist. This week he announced that South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley will be his U.N. ambassador despite having no experience in the State Department, and has reportedly asked Dr. Ben Carson \u2014 a chief rival during the Republican primaries \u2014 to be his Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).\u000a\u000aAt a press conference late Tuesday night, Trump gave some insight into his thinking process in inviting Carson into the role of HUD secretary.\u000a\u000a\u201cWell, I mean, you know, he\u2019s um, one of them, isn\u2019t he,\u201d Trump asked rhetorically.\u000a\u000aReporters asked Trump what he meant by \u201cone of them.\u201d The president-elect first just winked back at the reporters. When they didn\u2019t understand what he meant, he tried touching his nose. Exasperated, Mr. Trump finally answered the question in his trademark way.\u000a\u000a\u201cLook, he\u2019s one of them, you know what I mean,\u201d Trump said, \u201cyou know, his people are into jazz and they have an extra muscle that makes them good sports.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe press pool was still not quite sure what he meant. Trump tried again to explain to him why he was choosing Dr. Carson for his HUD secretaro.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s got the word urban in it, right,\u201d Trump asked, \u201cand when we think of urban we think of people of a certain\u2026type, right? You know they all smoke marihuana cigarrettes and their women are Jezebels, strong sexual appetites, know what I mean?\u201d\u000a\u000aStill, the reporters weren\u2019t quite understanding what Mr. Trump was getting at. He dug in even further.\u000a\u000a\u201cC\u2019mon people, follow me here,\u201d Trump implored them, \u201cthe job has the word urban in it, he\u2019s an urban. You know, an URBAN. Like, his people are incapable of self-care and sink into lunacy under the burden of freedom.\u201d\u000a\u000aLooking puzzled, members of the press pool still couldn\u2019t quite understand what Trump\u2019s meaning was. They pushed for more clarity. Growing ever more flustered, Mr. Trump tried to oblige.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou know, he could be a minstrel,\u201d Trump offered, \u201che\u2019s a good song and dance man, get it? Like, he\u2019s not going to go swimming any time soon, no matter how long ago he ate. Get it now? Huh?\u201d\u000a\u000aAfter fifteen more minutes of trying to get the reporters assembled there to understand him, Trump finally gave up. He dug into his pocket, and got out some black shoe polish. He also got out a large rag and started smearing the polish all over his face, except around his eyes and mouth, there he left his trademark orange skin intact. He began singing.\u000a\u000a\u201cEverything seems lovely when you start to roam,\u201d Trump sang out, continuing, \u201cThe birds are singin\u2019, the day that you stray. But wait until you are further away. Things won\u2019t be so lovely when you\u2019re all alone. Here\u2019s what you\u2019ll keep saying when you\u2019re far from home. Mammy, Mammy. The sun shines east, the sun shines west. I know where the sun shines best.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe media simply grew quiet, their jaws agape.\u000a\u000a\u201cMammy, my little Mammy,\u201d Trump forged on, \u201cMy heartstrings are tangled around Alabammy. I\u2019m comin\u2019, sorry that I made you wait. I\u2019m comin\u2019, hope and trust that I\u2019m not late, oh oh.\u000a\u000aMammy, my little Mammy. I\u2019d walk a million miles for one of your smiles. My Mammy, oh oh.\u201d\u000a\u000aNo one knew what to do, or what to say. So they just kept taking notes as Trump sang on.\u000a\u000a\u201cMammy, my little Mammy,\u201d Mr. Trump bellowed forth, \u201cThe sun shines east, the sun shines west. I know where, I know where the sun shines best. It\u2019s on my Mammy I\u2019m talkin\u2019 about, nobody else\u2019s. My little Mammy. My heartstrings are tangled around Alabammy. Mammy, Mammy, I\u2019m comin\u2019. I, I hope I didn\u2019t make you wait.\u201d\u000a\u000aNow, it seemed that trump was building a crescendo. He was clearly ready to bring it all home. The reporters still just watched in stunned amazement.\u000a\u000a\u201cMammy, Mammy, I\u2019m comin\u2019,\u201d Trump sang, \u201cOh God I, I hope I\u2019m not late. Mammy look at me. Don\u2019t you know me? I\u2019m your little baby. I\u2019d walk a million miles for one of your smiles\u000a\u000aMy Mammy!\u201d\u000a\u000aA report from NPR shows that Trump lost the popular vote by a margin of two million votes to Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton.\u000a\u000aRepublished from The Political Garbage Chute.\u000a\u000aFollow James on Twitter @JamboSchlarmbo.

VCINCINNATI, Ohio \u2014 Like many youngsters, 6-year-old Rogelio Fuentes recently awoke to a pair of soggy pajamas and a set of wet bed sheets \u2014 a normal part of childhood development, many doctors say. But thanks to a sharp-eyed mother on laundry day, Rogelio\u2019s nocturnal incontinence has brought him the 15 minutes of fame promised to everyone by the late \u201cpop\u201d artist, Andy Warhol.\u000a\u000aThe stain little Rogelio left in his wake bore an uncanny resemblance to the GOP\u2019s presumptive nominee, Donald J. Trump, according to the child\u2019s mother, Daisy.\u000a\u000aThis event is not number one, but number two in a series of Fuentes family excretory events calling attention to Trump. Nearly one year ago, Daisy claimed to see an image of Trump\u2019s face in her own stool \u2014 a story widely slammed as a tastelessly cruel, left-wing prank, perpetrated by Trump\u2019s enemies, and some say, by the Clinton campaign.\u000a\u000aLittle Rogelio says he was embarrassed when his story first leaked, but now is proud that the tale has spread. These days, the first grader says he wants to be president someday, \u201cjust like Donald Trump!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMy sister Blanca, she cries all day,\u201d said Rogelio, \u201cbecause she didn\u2019t \u2018make a Trump\u2019 yet, so my mother told her to pray. I hope she makes one soon, because she feels very sad.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cEveryone says we do these things to get revenge on Donald Trump because we\u2019re Mexican immigrants, but it\u2019s a stinking lie,\u201d says Daisy.\u000a\u000aThe Fuentes family entered the country legally, and want \u201cthe bad ones\u201d to stay out, just as Donald Trump does.\u000a\u000a\u201cAll good citizens should do their duty and make America great again! says Daisy.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cLast year, my husband got all stressed out because too many people put candles next to my Trump dump.

VVATICAN CITY \u2013 Pope Francis has invited people from all walks of life to the Vatican. Convicted felons, the homeless, even prostitutes have been welcomed into the Kingdom of God by the pontiff. Now, his holiness has sent an invitation to a group of people many thought would never be mentioned by name in the Catholic Church, juggalos.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u2018Juggalos\u2019 (or \u2018juggalettes\u2019 for females) is a name given to militant fans of the hip hop group Insane Clown Posse (ICP).

VDue to the increase of \u2018creepy clown threats\u2019 across the United States over the past few weeks, the United States Government has allegedly begun meetings regarding dealing with this threat on a national level. While local authorities have been left to deal with incidents like the ones in Puyallup, Washington, Sacramento, California, and Dallas, Texas \u2013 our sources claim that the Federal government is \u201cprepared to give aid to combat this threat\u201d.\u000a\u000aOver two years ago, this reporter covered the invasion of the small town of Wasco, California by a \u2018creepy clown\u2019. In the Wasco case, many inside the government believed it was a \u201cterror cell doing a dry run\u201d to stress test the response of local law enforcement. While the current outbreak of \u2018creepy clown threats\u2019 could largely be the cause of it being \u201cHalloween season\u201d and teenagers with too much time on their hands \u2013 many are not taking these threats lying down.\u000a\u000aI spoke directly to one of my most trusted sources in Washington, D.C., as several of these threats have hit very close to where I\u2019m based out of. My source reported back to me that these \u2018creepy clown threats\u2019 are being treated as a legitimate threat to America\u2019s safety. The source alleges that \u201cthe FBI is involved at this point. The President has also been briefed and is being kept current on these threats. The U.S. Government is taking this threat to the nation very seriously.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cCathy, you were really on to something with your reporting on the Wasco sightings a few years back. Even though the culprits were never truly outed, there was way more to that than was reported by everyone except National Report,\u201d my source told me. \u201cFrom what I\u2019ve seen and I\u2019ve been told by those \u2018in the know\u2019, these threats, by in large, are not just some drunken teenagers screwing around on Instagram. This is \u2018real deal terrorism\u2019 and could quickly escalate into something that rural sheriff\u2019s departments are not equipped to handle.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhen I pressed my source for more information, they just warned me to \u201cnot go out at night\u201d and \u201cavoid doing anything in the evening during the Halloween weekend\u201d. They alleged this was based on \u201cchatter\u201d they\u2019ve been privy to over the last few days. My source also suggested to avoid \u201cany and all locations that any of the \u2018creepy clown threat\u2019 social media accounts list\u201d. So, using their warning, if your teen\u2019s high school has been listed as a place a \u2018creepy clown\u2019 is going to hit up, it might be best for them to \u201ccome down with a cold\u201d until this all blows over.\u000a\u000aMy source stopped short of saying the National Guard has been mobilized to contain the \u2018creepy clown threats\u2019, but they did suggest an official statement from President Barack Obama was likely forthcoming on this issue. The source did say they were \u201cconcerned with Obama\u2019s potential response to this\u201d and suggesting that \u2018martial law\u2019 is a term that has been thrown around in \u201ctop level meetings\u201d for cities that are overrun with the clowns.\u000a\u000a(Image Source: Wiki)

VMOSCOW \u2014 Russian Federation President Vladimir Putin, in a bold, public display of support for US President-elect Donald Trump, will reportedly declare Friday, January 20, 2017 \u2014America\u2019s Inauguration Day\u2014 a Russian national holiday.\u000a\u000aThe unpresidented move sends an international signal of a growing alliance between the United States and the former Soviet Union, or at least between the Russian leader and the incoming president.\u000a\u000aThis new mutual admiration society builds on decades of unstable, cautious trust first established by former President Ronald Reagan in 1985.\u000a\u000aDuring that year, Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev met in Geneva, Switzerland for an historic summit meeting, followed by a 1986 conference in Reykjavik, Iceland.\u000a\u000aIn the shadow of Barack Obama\u2019s retaliation for what he claimed was Soviet interference in the US election, Donald Trump\u2019s positive praise for Putin\u2019s restrained response \u2014detailed in a pinned tweet\u2014 set in motion this latest display of international intercourse.\u000a\u000aAlthough the national holiday declaration is not yet officially confirmed, government sources say Putin is \u201cstrongly suggesting\u201d that businesses and schools take the day off to witness Trump\u2019s historic inauguration, and to celebrate the new administration along with the United States.\u000a\u000a\u201cMany businesses are ordering American style inauguration souvenirs,\u201d said market trend watcher Althea Thoone. \u201cSchool children are learning The Star Spangled Banner, and I\u2019m told preschoolers are being taught popular American slogans phonetically. No one has witnessed anything like this!\u201d Thoone said.\u000a\u000aIvanka, Eric, and Tiffany are trending Russian baby names, as is Vladimir for American newborns, according to a new poll.\u000a\u000aIf any complaints exist about lost revenue resulting from the nationwide business closures, Russian citizens are keeping their grumblings private.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think it is a wonderful event,\u201d said dashcam salesman Yakov Pokhis. \u201cIt will be a glorious thing when our two countries can become great again together! What a country!\u201d he added.\u000a\u000aSeen as a one-time, ceremonial holiday declaration, the official designation of a permanent, annual Jan. 20 celebration is not expected.

VA report of out of Washington D.C. alleges that the bird that \u201cdropped in\u201d on a Bernie Sanders rally in Portland, Oregon was not \u201can organic bird\u201d, but a United States Government drone. The report comes from a White House insider, who speaking anonymously, has led this reporter to the possibility that the \u201cBernie Sanders bird\u201d was really just an errant surveillance drone spying on the candidate for Hillary Clinton.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think it\u2019s safe to assume that the President (Obama) and his administration are, not so publicly, endorsing Hillary Clinton for the upcoming election,\u201d said the Washington insider. \u201cI can neither confirm, nor deny, that the President may or may not have specialized UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) that may or may not have been tasked to follow specific candidates that are running against Hillary Clinton.\u201d While the insider used typical Washington doublespeak to not exactly commit to the bird being a man-made creation, someone in the audience at the rally also agreed that things seemed suspicious.\u000a\u000a\u201cI actually followed the bird and heard unnatural sounds coming from it,\u201d claims Marco Roberson, an Engineering major at Portland State University. \u201cI heard sounds coming from the \u2018bird\u2019 that were clearly mechanical in nature.

VNEW YORK, NEW YORK \u2014 In a blast of tweets Sunday afternoon, President-Elect Donald Trump raised eyebrows all over the country by seemingly implying that the election he himself won was fraught with voter fraud.\u000a\u000aWithout citing any evidence for his claim, Trump announced on Twitter that he\u2019d have \u201cwon the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally.\u201d Several news outlets have confirmed that to date no evidence has been brought forth that could remotely substantiate Mr. Trump\u2019s assertion. Many are confused why Trump would bring the issue up, considering he actually won, and casting doubt on the legitimacy of the election hurts him as well. Still others pointed out that heretofore Trump supporters have been nonchalant about facts, so perhaps it won\u2019t hurt him at all.\u000a\u000aIn addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 27, 2016\u000a\u000aOn Monday morning, Trump doubled-down on even expanded his claims of illegal immigrant voting, as well as boasting about curing one of mankind\u2019s most deadly viruses.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u201cIn the coming days, at some point,\u201d Trump told reporters outside his Trump Tower home, \u201cI will provide you evidence that around ten billion \u2014 that\u2019s billion with a B people \u2014 illegal immigrants voted for Hillary Clinton, and I will also provide you the antidote to AIDS that I just developed all by myself, literally while just making a ham and cheese on rye sandwich in the kitchen. When you\u2019re a winner like me, great things just sort of accidentally happen like shitting your pants. Except you know, instead of feces in your trousers, you have the cure for AIDS. No big whoop.\u201d\u000a\u000aAfter claiming that ten billion \u201cillegal aliens\u201d voted for Ms. Clinton in the election, reporters were eager to ask for proof. They pointed out that there are only currently about seven billion people in total on the planet. They also cited surveys that put the estimated total undocumented population in the U.S. at just about eleven million. Trump\u2019s story seemed to ignore both those facts.\u000a\u000a\u201cFacts, you wanna talk about facts in 2016,\u201d Trump laughed out loud, \u201cfacts don\u2019t matter anymore. As long as a tell a lie big enough, and keep repeating it over and over again, my voters will believe it. They already somehow believed that three million illegals \u2014 who can\u2019t register to vote without state IDs they can\u2019t get without U.S. citizenship \u2014 voted in the election, but that lie just wasn\u2019t big enough. So Herr \u2014 er I mean MISTER \u2014 Bannon told me to make the lie bigger, bolder. So that\u2019s what I did. Bing-bang-boom. Ten billion Mexicans from Mexico voted for Hillary illegally.\u201d\u000a\u000aUndaunted, reporters pressed Trump for evidence that there are even ten billion people living on Earth. Trump told them he had the evidence \u201cright here\u201d and he fished into his pocket, quickly removing it and showing them all his single, extended middle right finger.

Many are confused why Trump would bring the issue up, considering he actually won, and casting doubt on the legitimacy of the election hurts him as well. Still others pointed out that heretofore Trump supporters have been nonchalant about facts, so perhaps it won&#8217;t hurt him at all.</p>\u000a<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\u000a<p lang="en" dir="ltr">In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally</p>\u000a<p>&#8212; Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/802972944532209664">November 27, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\u000a<p></p>\u000a<p>On Monday morning, Trump doubled-down on even expanded his claims of illegal immigrant voting, as well as boasting about curing one of mankind&#8217;s most deadly viruses.</p>\u000a<p>\u000a<br>\u000a \u000a</p>\u000a<p>&#8220;In the coming days, at some point,&#8221; Trump told reporters outside his Trump Tower home, &#8220;I will provide you evidence that around ten billion &#8212; that&#8217;s billion with a B people &#8212; illegal immigrants voted for Hillary Clinton, and I will also provide you the antidote to AIDS that I just developed all by myself, literally while just making a ham and cheese on rye sandwich in the kitchen. When you&#8217;re a winner like me, great things just sort of accidentally happen like shitting your pants. Except you know, instead of feces in your trousers, you have the cure for AIDS. No big whoop.&#8221;</p>\u000a<p>After claiming that ten billion &#8220;illegal aliens&#8221; voted for Ms. Clinton in the election, reporters were eager to ask for proof. They pointed out that there are only currently about seven billion people in total on the planet. They also cited surveys that put the estimated total undocumented population in the U.S. at just about eleven million. Trump&#8217;s story seemed to ignore both those facts.</p>\u000a<p>&#8220;Facts, you wanna talk about facts in 2016,&#8221; Trump laughed out loud, &#8220;facts don&#8217;t matter anymore. As long as a tell a lie big enough, and keep repeating it over and over again, my voters will believe it. They already somehow believed that three million illegals &#8212; who can&#8217;t register to vote without state IDs they can&#8217;t get without U.S. citizenship &#8212; voted in the election, but that lie just wasn&#8217;t big enough. So Herr &#8212; er I mean MISTER &#8212; Bannon told me to make the lie bigger, bolder. So that&#8217;s what I did. Bing-bang-boom. Ten billion Mexicans from Mexico voted for Hillary illegally.&#8221;</p>\u000a<p>Undaunted, reporters pressed Trump for evidence that there are even ten billion people living on Earth. Trump told them he had the evidence &#8220;right here&#8221; and he fished into his pocket, quickly removing it and showing them all his single, extended middle right finger. After getting extremely close to Trump to verify it was his finger and not his penis, the press pool took a hint and moved onto his claim about curing AIDS.</p>\u000a<p>&#8220;I never said that,&#8221; Trump said.</p>\u000a<p>&#8220;But, you just said that,&#8221; a reporter shot back.</p>\u000a<p>&#8220;No, I didn&#8217;t.

VStores Report "Run on Pressure Cookers" after NYC Bombing

VRetailers across the United States are reporting a spike in sales of pressure cookers following alleged terrorist bombings in New York City and New Jersey over the weekend. While the New Jersey incident featured \u201cpipe-bomb-style\u201d devices, the New York explosion was caused by a \u201cpressure cooker device\u201d and resulted in twenty-nine injuries. Astute readers will recall that the Boston Marathon bombers used pressure cooker bombs to create terror in 2013. Much like how firearms advocates fear a \u201cgun grab\u201d by Obama after a mass shooting incident, many United States citizens are fearing a similar \u201cgrab\u201d may happen to their cherished cookers.\u000a\u000a\u201cThey\u2019ll get my cooker from my cold dead hands,\u201d said Ruth Webb, 75, of Fort Worth, Texas. \u201cMy grandkids will not be denied my signature slow cooked beans! You know Hillary is going to use these attacks to restrict our freedoms. Trump 2016!\u201d Webb, and other amateur chefs have flooded social media, specifically \u201cBuy, Sale, Trade\u201d groups on Facebook to stockpile as many pressure cookers as possible. Of course, this has led to some unscrupulous sellers to hike prices on their stock to gouge fearful consumers. \u201cI saw a guy trying to sell a \u2018Presto 01264 6 quart\u2019 model on my local Facebook group for $500,\u201d explained Keith Nelson of Buffalo, New York. \u201cIt\u2019s insane. Those usually sell for around $30 online. The sad thing is many people in the group are afraid Obama or Hillary are going to ban these cookers to \u2018crack down on terrorism\u2019. Meanwhile, these scammers are laughing all of the way to the bank.\u201d\u000a\u000aNo retailers would issue a statement to us regarding this alleged run on pressure cookers. However, we sent an intern to the local Wal-Mart and Target this Sunday afternoon, and he reported that there \u201cdidn\u2019t appear to be any in stock\u201d when he checked. He\u2019s also new and we\u2019re not entirely sure he understood what a pressure cooker is.\u000a\u000aEven after the tragic bombings in 2013, the government has not officially suggested they will restrict the production or sale of pressure cookers \u2013 even when considering their potential dual use in improvised explosives. That still does nothing to assuage the fears of Marge Novak, a retired grandmother from Lexington, Kentucky. Novak posted in a Lexington cooking group that she has \u201calready spent her monthly allowance\u201d on pressure cookers and is \u201clooking to buy as many more as possible on credit or layaway\u201d.\u000a\u000a(Image Source: Wiki)

Trump 2016!&#8221; Webb, and other amateur chefs have flooded social media, specifically &#8220;Buy, Sale, Trade&#8221; groups on Facebook to stockpile as many pressure cookers as possible. Of course, this has led to some unscrupulous sellers to hike prices on their stock to gouge fearful consumers. &#8220;I saw a guy trying to sell a &#8216;Presto 01264 6 quart&#8217; model on my local Facebook group for $500,&#8221; explained Keith Nelson of Buffalo, New York. &#8220;It&#8217;s insane. Those usually sell for around $30 online. The sad thing is many people in the group are afraid Obama or Hillary are going to ban these cookers to &#8216;crack down on terrorism&#8217;. Meanwhile, these scammers are laughing all of the way to the bank.&#8221;</p>\u000a<p>No retailers would issue a statement to us regarding this alleged run on pressure cookers. However, we sent an intern to the local Wal-Mart and Target this Sunday afternoon, and he reported that there &#8220;didn&#8217;t appear to be any in stock&#8221; when he checked. He&#8217;s also new and we&#8217;re not entirely sure he understood what a pressure cooker is.</p>\u000a<p>Even after the tragic bombings in 2013, the government has not officially suggested they will restrict the production or sale of pressure cookers &#8211; even when considering their potential dual use in improvised explosives. That still does nothing to assuage the fears of Marge Novak, a retired grandmother from Lexington, Kentucky. Novak posted in a Lexington cooking group that she has &#8220;already spent her monthly allowance&#8221; on pressure cookers and is &#8220;looking to buy as many more as possible on credit or layaway&#8221;.</p>\u000a<p>(Image Source: <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Pressure.cooker.jpg" target="_blank">Wiki</a>)</p>\u000a							&#13;\u000a				 \u000a     \u000a \u000a\u000a \u000a \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a<p id="rcjsload_4a0f4b"></p>\u000a\u000a \u000a\u000a<p id="taboola-below-article"></p>\u000a			&#13;\u000a			</div>

VWASILLA, Alaska \u2014 A newly discovered essay entitled \u201cMy Most Admired Woman in History,\u201d reportedly written by former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, names cartoon character Wilma Flintstone as \u201cAmerica\u2019s most historical female influence.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe term paper, written in 1981, was anonymously donated to the Wasilla High School library archives for inclusion in a proposed Sarah Palin Center for Special Studies. The hand-written paper lists Sarah Heath of Wasilla High School as author.\u000a\u000a\u201cI picked Wilma Flintstone as my most admired figurine of history,\u201d the essay begins, \u201cbecause of the many historical hardships she faced without modern appliances, gadgets, and short cuts that we have at our fingertips today, thank God.\u201d\u000a\u000aPerhaps the then 17-year-old Sarah Heath was unaware of the swordfish bread knife, pelican washing machine, and wooly mammoth vacuum cleaner that made Wilma\u2019s day so much easier, not to mention the bird broom, porcupine hairbrush, and tortoise lawnmower.\u000a\u000aWilma\u2019s inner strength and versatility amidst Bedrock\u2018s available resources also was outlined:\u000a\u000a\u201cWilma did not let the small town of Bedrock\u2019s limitedness limit her. By doing such a thing, she set a standard for modern women of today. I am sad to say however, that many of us take her years of sacrifice and toil for granite.\u201d\u000a\u000aPalin\u2019s essay also calls Wilma \u201ca pioneering innovator,\u201d far ahead of her prehistoric time:\u000a\u000a\u201cWilma raised a family, worked part-time jobs sometimes, and put up with a loudmouth husband, and she still found the time to maintain her appearance even though she only had one dress and no shoes. She did the best with what she had, even using rocks for a necklace and animal bones for hair curlers.\u201d\u000a\u000aPalin\u2019s essay ends on a cautionary note, reminding 1981\u2019s modern women to be mindful of Wilma\u2019s legacy:\u000a\u000a\u201cDo not let Wilma Flintstone\u2019s example get swept under the rug, or else one day the strives we have made as women will fade away, like a cave painting. We might all be dragged back to our caves by our hair, barefoot and pregnant, cooking our food over a burning pile of history that we all forgot about.\u201d\u000a\u000aCalls to Sarah Palin\u2019s publicist were not returned as of publication time. No word yet on the completion or dedication date for Wasilla High School\u2019s Sarah Palin Center for Special Studies.

VCINCINNATI, Ohio \u2014 Like many youngsters, 6-year-old Rogelio Fuentes recently awoke to a pair of soggy pajamas and a set of wet bed sheets \u2014 a normal part of childhood development, many doctors say. But thanks to a sharp-eyed mother on laundry day, Rogelio\u2019s nocturnal incontinence has brought him the 15 minutes of fame promised to everyone by the late \u201cpop\u201d artist, Andy Warhol.\u000a\u000aThe stain little Rogelio left in his wake bore an uncanny resemblance to the GOP\u2019s presumptive nominee, Donald J.

Nearly one year ago, Daisy claimed to see an image of Trump\u2019s face in her own stool \u2014 a story widely slammed as a tastelessly cruel, left-wing prank, perpetrated by Trump\u2019s enemies, and some say, by the Clinton campaign.\u000a\u000aLittle Rogelio says he was embarrassed when his story first leaked, but now is proud that the tale has spread. These days, the first grader says he wants to be president someday, \u201cjust like Donald Trump!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMy sister Blanca, she cries all day,\u201d said Rogelio, \u201cbecause she didn\u2019t \u2018make a Trump\u2019 yet, so my mother told her to pray.

VReality television star and shrewd businessman, Donald Trump, received yet another feather in his cap early Wednesday, November 9th. Trump, 70, was given an \u201chonorary degree\u201d from the higher learning institution, Electoral College. Trump, as of this writing, appears to have received 279 votes by board members of Electoral College. Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, also in the running for the honorary degree received, at press time, 228 votes from the Electoral College board.\u000a\u000aA minimum of 270 votes of support from Electoral College board members is required for an individual to receive an honorary degree from the higher learning institute. Past recipients of this degree include President Barack Obama (2008 and again in 2012), George W. Bush (2000 and 2004), and Secretary Clinton\u2019s husband, Bill, who also received the honor twice in the 1990s. Trump becomes the 44th individual to receive the coveted Electoral College degree since the institution\u2019s founding in 1787.\u000a\u000a\u201cMany people like to argue that Donald Trump will be the 45th person to receive the degree from Electoral College,\u201d explains education expert Justin Hill. \u201cBut, in fact, the records from the college have former President Grover Cleveland listed twice, largely because he was not awarded the degree in back to back \u2018elections\u2019. Regardless, very few people receive this honor and I imagine Mr. Trump and his family are very appreciative and humbled by this incredible honor.\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. Trump gave a brief speech early Wednesday morning where he accepted the award and thanked his family and colleagues for their support. Trump will be formally given his honorary degree from Electoral College on Friday, January 20th, 2017 in a modest ceremony on the steps of the United States Capitol Building in Washington, D.C.\u000a\u000a\u201cAdditional perks that Mr. Trump will receive (in addition to the honorary degree) include him being granted the title of \u2018Mr. President\u2019, government-funded housing in Washington, D.C., a yearly government stipend, and 24/7 \u2018around the clock\u2019 armed security to protect him from ne\u2019er-do-wells,\u201d adds Hill.\u000a\u000aAs of Wednesday morning, Secretary of State Clinton and Russian President Vladimir Putin have both congratulated Trump on receiving his honorary degree from Electoral College.
